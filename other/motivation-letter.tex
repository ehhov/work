    \opening{Dear Selection Committee,}

    \medskip

    I~am writing to~express my~interest in~the~PhD student position 
    in~experimental particle physics offered by~the~High Energy Physics 
    Laboratory of~EPFL, as~I~have always been greatly interested 
    in~Fundamental Physics, and the~LPHE of~EPFL is~among the~best 
    centers in~the~world to~work on~cutting-edge projects in~Particle 
    Physics.

    I~became part of~the~LHCb Collaboration back in~2019 thanks to~ITEP, 
    a~major fundamental physics laboratory in~the~Soviet Union and later 
    in~Russia. My~fascination with the~LHCb Experiment has grown ever 
    since joining~it with~every piece of~information I~learned about~it. 
    My~knowledge of~the~detector software combined with a~deep 
    understanding of~the~underlying physics and~maths allowed me 
    to~reinforce my~involvement in~accelerator-based particle physics 
    research.
    % greatly increase my~performance with {\color{red} .... what?}

    The~years of~studying at~Lomonosov Moscow State University provided 
    me with a~strong base of~mathematics, calculus, statistics, 
    and~a~broad range of~general and~specialized physics fields as~well 
    as~modern data processing technologies.
    %
    My~studying approach has~proven exceptionally successful, 
    as~I~shared the~first place in~graduate rankings with~2~other 
    students with perfect grade records, having received only 
    the~highest grades for~all~exams throughout the~6~years. My~deep 
    understanding of~the~subjects we learned let me help all 
    my~groupmates and other students at~the~Faculty of~Physics, with 
    several professors thanking me personally for~playing such~an~active 
    role in~the~teaching process.

    At~the~same time, working in~the~LHCb Groups at~ITEP and SINP MSU 
    introduced me to~the~field of~experimental particle physics. When 
    I~first came to~the research group, I~was instantly engaged 
    in~the~analysis of~the $\Lambda_b^0\to{D}^{(*)+}p\pi^-\pi^-$ decays.
    %, which had already {\color{red} reached a later stage}.
    %
    My~work with the~fitting model was a~great entry point and allowed 
    me to~contribute to~the~analysis up~to its~publication in~JHEP.
    %
    Having learned the~LHCb research approaches, now~I~am the~leading 
    physicist in~the~analysis of~charm baryon resonant contributions 
    in~the $\Lambda_b^0\to\Lambda_c^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-$ decay.

    My~learning habits have been very fruitful {in~extracurricular 
    activities} as~well. Programming has been a~passion of~mine for over 
    6~years, and I've gathered much software experience with multiple 
    programming languages as~well as~Linux and~Git.
    %
    Even though my years of active study and research haven't yet 
    allowed me to gain hardware experience, I am very eager to acquire 
    it and enthusiastic about such opportunities. My~software experience 
    could help me~get involved in~hardware projects.

    I~believe I'd~be a~good fit for the~position and would fulfill 
    the~requirements as~I~have much interest in fundamental research, 
    great experience with data analysis and programming, and~possess 
    the~skills of~long-term learning as~well as~teaching. I'd~love to~be 
    part of~the~PhD program at~the LPHE of EPFL and~make my~contribution 
    to~the~particle physics projects at~your laboratory.

    \medskip
    Thank you for your consideration.

    \closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
