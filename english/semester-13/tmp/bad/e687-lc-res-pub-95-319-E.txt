In this paper we report on the study of charm baryons which strongly decay to the lowest
mass charm baryon +c , namely ?c + (2625) ! +c +  , ?c + (2593) ! +c +  , 0c ! +c 
and ++
! +c + (throughout this paper charge conjugate states are implicitly assumed). Sev-
c
eral experiments have observed the isospin triplet states 0c , +c , ++
c which decay strongly to
+c . Here we concentrate only on the two decays 0c ! +c  and ++
! +c + , since our
c
reconstruction eciency for 0 is considerably lower than for  . Few experiments have ob-
served the ?c + excited states. ARGUS[1], CLEO[2] and E687[3] have reported the existence of
one such state, the ?c + (2625) , with a mass di erence M(?c + (2625) ) M(+c ) ' 341MeV=c2,
reconstructed through its decay to +c  + . ARGUS reports a signi cant resonant component
for the decay, (?c + (2625) ! c  )/ (?c + (2625) ! +c +  ) = 0:46  0:14, yet both CLEO
and E687 did not see any resonant decay: E687[3] estimated the total resonant fraction to be
BR(?c + (2625) ! c  / ?c + (2625) ! +c +  ) < 0:36 (90% c.l.) and CLEO[4] measured
the two separate upper limits BR(?c + (2625) ! 0c + / ?c + (2625) ! +c +  ) < 0:07 and
?+
+ +
BR(?c + (2625) ! ++
c  / c (2625) ! c   ) < 0:08 (90% c.l.). CLEO[4] has also reported
evidence for a lower mass ?c + excited state, which we shall refer to as ?c + (2593) , at a mass dif-
ference M(?c + (2593) ) M(+c ) = 307:5  0:4  1:0MeV=c2. The ?c + (2593) was reconstructed
from the nal state +c  + , and the resonant decay ?c + (2593) ! c  , c ! +c  (where the
?+
c can either be a 0c or a ++
c ) was reported to be dominant. In our earlier c paper, where we
reconstrcted +c only in the decay mode +c ! pK + , we could neither con rm nor rule out the
existence of such a state. In this paper we make use of more +c decay modes and tighter analysis
conditions, and we are able to present evidence for a ?c + signal at approximately the same mass
di erence as the observed CLEO ?c + (2593) state.
The newly discovered ?c + states have been interpreted[5] as a ne structure doublet in which
the light diquark ud carries a unit of orbital angular momentum L = 1 with respect to the heavy c
quark. Combining this orbital angular momentum with the spin S = 21 of the baryon, the two states
have been assumed to have total angular momentum and parity J P as follows: ?c + (2593) = 21
and ?c + (2625) = 32 , with the isospin for both being I = 0. The ?c + can not decay to +c via single
pion emission because of isospin conservation but requires two pions in the nal state. Angular
momentum and parity conservation allow the state ?c + ( 21 ) to decay to the intermediate resonant
state c ( 12 + ) via an S-wave, but the state ?c + ( 32 ) would have to decay to c ( 12 + ) via a D-wave.
Therefore the resonant decay ?c + (2625) ! c  (c ! +c ) should be strongly suppressed,
3while the decay ?c + (2593) ! c  (c ! +c ) should not. Thus the analysis of the resonant
components of the decays of the ?c + is important in establishing the true nature of the states.
The analysis presented in this paper is based on the data collected at Fermilab during the 1990-
91 xed target run by high energy photoproduction experiment E687. Photons of average tagged
energy E = 220 GeV impacted on a 4 cm long Beryllium target and produced charm hadrons.
The charm decay products were detected by a multi-purpose spectrometer which is described in
detail elsewhere[6]. This analysis makes use of the information from the charge tracking system and
the C erenkov counters for particle identi cation. The charged tracking system is composed of a
high resolution silicon microvertex detector, 5 stations of multi-wire proportional chambers and two
analyzing magnets with opposite polarities. We rst reconstruct +c via their decays to pK + ,
pK 0 , pK 0 +  , 0 + and 0+  + and then we combine the +c with one or two additional
pions to search for higher mass charm states (?c + , c ).
The +c candidates are reconstructed through a candidate driven vertex algorithm[6]. The neu-
tral daughters of the +c decay (K 0 and 0 ) are identi ed via their decays Ks0 ! +  and
0 ! p . In both cases two oppositely charged tracks (reconstructed by either the silicon vertex
detector and the PWC system or by the PWC system alone) are required to originate from a common
vertex and the invariant mass of the pair is required to be contained within a certain range of the
K 0 or 0 nominal masses. The charged +c decay daughters (p,K  , ) are reconstructed as linked
microstrip-PWC tracks which satisfy the identi cation by the C erenkov system: the protons must be
identi ed as proton de nite or p=K ambiguous, the kaons must be kaon de nite or p=K ambiguous
and the pions must not be identi ed as de nite electrons, kaons, protons or p=K ambiguous. For
each decay mode, all the decay daughters have to extrapolate back to a single point (the secondary
or decay vertex) with a con dence level greater than 1%. The primary vertex is constructed by
intersecting the momentum vector of the reconstructed +c with the remaining microstrip tracks and
by requiring the con dence level of the total object to be greater than 1%. The distance between
the two vertices, L, is computed and divided by its error, L to determine the signi cance of the
detachment between production and decay vertices: L=L. The +c must also satisfy some isolation
criteria: tracks from the secondary vertex can not be compatible with coming from the primary
vertex and other tracks in the event can not be compatible with coming from the secondary vertex.
The full set of analysis cuts employed for each decay mode is described in Table I. In Figure 1
we show the cumulative +c sample reconstructed through the ve decay modes mentioned above.
4The invariant mass distribution is t with a Gaussian function for the signal plus a second degree
polynomial for the background, giving a yield of Y (+c ) = 1564  101 events.
For each decay mode, we select +c combinations which are contained within approximately 2
of the nominal +c mass, and we compute the invariant mass of the +c with one or two (oppositely
charged) tracks coming from the primary vertex. These additional tracks are linked microstrip-
PWC tracks and the C erenkov identi cation must be compatible with the pion hypothesis (same
as above). In order to reduce systematic errors in the mass measurements, we measure the mass
di erence between the +c + pion(s) state and the original +c state.
In Figure 2 we present the mass di erence M(+c  + ) M(+c ): there is evidence for two
peaks above the background. The histogram is t with two Gaussian functions for the signals plus a
second degree polynomial for the background. The t yields Y1 = 13:9  4:5 events for the lower mass
peak, and Y2 = 38:8  8:0 events for the upper mass peak. The tted mass di erences are M1 =
309:20:7MeV=c2 and M2 = 341:40:4MeV=c2, respectively. Since our value M1 agrees with the
mass di erence measured by CLEO[4] for the ?c + (2593) state (see Table II), we con rm the existence
of the ?c + (2593) . The width of the ?c + (2593) peak is measured to be 1 = 1:8  0:6MeV=c2, which
is consistent with our Monte Carlo simulation of a zero intrinsic width particle. We checked the
stability of the ?c + (2593) signal when di erent sets of analysis cuts were applied and found that both
the ?c + (2593) mass and the ratio of the two yields Y (?c + (2593) )=Y (?c + (2625) ) were consistent
within the statistical errors to the quoted values for each cut tested.
We quote a conservative upper limit of 0:3MeV=c2 as a systematic error in the ?c + (2593) mass
measurement. This uncertainty is derived from uctuations in the tted mass observed when dif-
ferent tting techniques and analysis cuts are applied and when the pK + mode alone is used
to reconstuct +c candidates. Monte Carlo studies show that the shift between the generated and
reconstructed mass di erence M(?c + (2593) ) M(+c ) is negligible.
In our previous paper[3] we investigated the resonant decays ?c ! 0c + (0c ! +c  )
++ ! + + ) for the ?+ (2625) state. Since we did not nd any evi-

dence for an intermediate resonant state, we measured the upper limit BR(?c + (2625) ! c  /
?c + (2625) ! +c +  ) < 0:36 at 90% con dence level. In this paper we perform the same study
for the ?c + (2593) state, using only our cleanest and most copious +c signal, that which is recon-
structed via the +c ! pK + decay mode (with the analysis cuts described in Table I). In Figure
3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) we plot the mass di erences M(+c  + ) M(+c ), M(+c  ) M(+c )
5and M(+c + ) M(+c ) (where in all cases +c ! pK + ), showing evidence for the four states
?c + (2593) , ?c + (2625) , 0c and ++
c , respectively. The histograms are t with Gaussian curves
for signals plus a second degree polynomial for the background. The yields resulting from the ts
are listed in Table III, together with the corresponding Monte Carlo reconstruction eciency for
each channel. In Figure 3(d) we plot again the mass di erences M(+c  + ) M(+c ) with the
additional requirement that one of the two submasses +c  is compatible with being either a 0c

++
or a ++
c (within 4MeV=c ( 2) of the values for the c and c masses obtained from his-
tograms 3(b) and 3(c)). The tted yields for the ?c + states after the c requirement has been
imposed are Y (?c + (2593) ) = 10:4  3:4 and Y (?c + (2625) ) = 10:6  3:7 events (which must
be compared to the yields obtained without the c requirement: Y (?c + (2593) ) = 10:2  3:7
and Y (?c + (2625) ) = 24:4  6:3). If the same c cut is applied to non-resonant ?c + (2593) !
+c +  and ?c + (2625) ! +c +  Monte Carlo samples, it is found that 33.2% and 31.2% (re-
spectively) of the original ?c + yield is retained. This shows that the ?c + (2593) sample is consistent
with being completely resonant, while the ?c + (2625) sample (as expected from our previous analy-
sis) is consistent with being completely non-resonant.
We also measured a lower limit for the resonant fraction of the ?c + (2593) ! +c +  decay.
We looked at the M(+c  + ) M(+c ) mass di erence when one of the two submasses +c  is
contained within one of two (properly normalized) sidebands of the 0c , ++
c masses and subtracted
this contribution from the ?c + (2593) yield obtained in Figure 3(d). At 90% con dence level, we
found:
+?

BR( +?c (2593) ! +c+ ) > 51%
c (2593) ! c  
Our results for the resonant fraction of the ?c + (2593) ! +c +  and ?c + (2625) ! +c +  decays
agree with the results found by CLEO[4] and support the interpretation of the ?c + (2593) as the
J P = 21 state and the ?c + (2625) as the J P = 32 state of the orbitally excited ?c + doublet.
We use the charm baryon signals in Figures 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) to measure the inclusive pho-
toproduction cross sections of ?c + and c relative to the inclusive photoproduction cross section of
+c . For c we use the formula:
c =
Y (c )
(c ! pK)  BR(c ! pK)

c (c ! c ; c ! pK)  BR(c ! c )  BR(c ! pK)
Y (c)
( denotes the Monte Carlo reconstruction eciency and BR a Branching Ratio), where we assume
BR(c ! c ) = 1.
6In the case of ?c we use the formula:

Y (?c )
(c ! pK)

c (c ! c; c ! pK)  BR(c ! c   )

but this time BR(+c ? ! +c +  ) 6= 1 since the +c ? can also decay to +c 0 0 . We thus measure
the combined quantity:

The measured relative photoproduction cross sections are listed in Table III. We conservatively
estimate that any systematics due to tracking is less than 4% per track. We checked the stability
of our results by using di erent analysis cuts and di erent tting techniques and found that the
uctuations were consistent within statistical errors to the quoted values for each test. We also
investigated a possible dependence of the measured values on the momentum of the reconstructed
+c . We divided the +c momentum spectrum into three di erent ranges (between 30 and 60 GeV/c,
between 60 and 90 GeV/c, above 90 GeV/c); tted each data histogram separately; computed
the Monte Carlo reconstruction eciency for each momentum range; and nally summed the three
eciency-corrected yields. The results obtained with this momentum dependent eciency technique
proved to be in agreement, within the statistical errors, with the ones obtained by use of global
reconstruction eciencies.
We can perform a rough estimate of the number of +c originating from higher mass charm
baryons by summing the relative photoproduction cross sections for each of the ?c + and c states
observed. For the c , we average the two results for 0c and ++
c and multiply by 3 to take into
account the decay mode +c ! +c 0 , which is not reconstructed in this analysis but nevertheless
contributes to the total +c ! pK + sample observed. For the ?c + , we assume that the decay
?c + (2593) ! +c +  is completely dominated by the resonant mode ?c + (2593) ! c  (c !
+c  ), so that these events are already included in the 0c , ++
c photoproduction cross sections.
On the other hand we assume the decay ?c + (2625) ! +c +  to be completely non-resonant and
also take BR(?c + (2625) ! +c +  ) to be 2=3 (from isospin invariance). We obtain:

Finally we measure the mass di erence between each of the two c states and the +c . For the
measurement, we use the c signals reconstructed through the +c ! pK + decay mode, but we
subject the signals to tighter analysis cuts than those listed in Table I in order to improve the signal
7to noise: we require the con dence level of the +c decay vertex to be greater than 5% and at least one
of the two heavy prongs of the decay (i.e. the proton or the kaon) to be positively identi ed by the
C erenkov counters. We also use c candidates reconstructed via the +c ! pK 0 decay mode, where
(with respect to the cuts used in Table I) we tighten the invariant mass cut around the nominal
+c mass to be M = 20MeV and we require the error on the primary and secondary vertex
separation to be less than L < 1:5mm. Figure 4(a) and 4(b) show the M(+c  ) M(+c ) and
M(+c + ) M(+c ) mass di erences for the combined pK + + pK 0 sample with the additional
analysis cuts. Both histograms are t with a Gaussian curve for the signal (with a xed width of
 = 2:2MeV determined from Monte Carlo simulation) plus a second degree polynomial for the
background. The resulting mass di erences are M(0c ) M(+c ) = 166:6  0:5  0:6MeV=c2 and
+
2
M(++
c ) M(c ) = 167:6  0:6  0:6MeV=c where the second error is the systematic uncertainty.
The systematic error is determined from non-statistical uctuations of the measured values when the
total 0c , ++
c samples are split into four statistically separate subsamples: candidates originating
from di erent +c decays (pK + or pK 0) and data taken by our experiment during two di erent
run periods (1990 or 1991). The larger systematic error in the measurement of the c masses, as
compared to the measurement of the ?c + (2593) mass, re ects the higher level of background under
the 0c , ++
c signals.
In Table II we summarize our measurements for the M(?c + ) M(+c ) and M(c ) M(+c )
mass di erences and compare them to the values obtained by CLEO [4] [8] and to the current PDG
world averages[9].
In conclusion, we present con rming evidence for the excited state ?c + (2593) rst observed by
CLEO[4] and we measure its mass to be M(?c + (2593) ) M(+c ) = 309:2  0:7  0:3MeV=c2 above
the +c mass. We observe the resonant fraction of the decay ?c + (2593) ! c  to be dominant
and we estimate the lower limit BR(?c + (2593) ! c  / ?c + (2593) ! +c +  ) > 0:51 (90%
+
0
c.l.). We further measure the mass di erences between the 0c , ++
c and the c to be M(c )
M(+c ) = 166:6  0:5  0:6MeV=c2 and M(++
M(+c ) = 167:6  0:6  0:6MeV=c2. We

measure the photoproduction cross section for the ?c + (2625) , ?c + (2593) , 0c and ++
c relative to
the inclusive photoproduction cross section for the +c . Our data indicate that roughly a third of
the photoproduced +c comes from the decay of higher mass charm baryon states
