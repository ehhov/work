              1 Introduction
              Decays of beauty baryons to purely hadronic ﬁnal states provide a wealth of information
              about the interactions between the fundamental constituents of matter. Studies of direct
              CP violation in these decays can help constrain the parameters of the Standard Model and
              New Physics eﬀects in a similar way as in decays of beauty mesons [1–7]. Studies of the
              decay dynamics of beauty baryons can provide important information on the spectroscopy
              of charmed baryons, since the known initial state provides strong constraints on the
              quantum numbers of intermediate resonances. The recent observation of pentaquark
              states at LHCb [8] has renewed the interest in baryon spectroscopy.
                  The present analysis concerns the decay amplitude of the Cabibbo-favoured decay
              Λ0 →D0pπ− (the inclusion of charge-conjugate processes is implied throughout this
                b
              paper). A measurement of the branching fraction of this decay with respect to the
              Λ0 →Λ+π− mode was reported by the LHCb collaboration using a data sample cor-

              responding to 1.0fb    of integrated luminosity [9]. The Λb → D pπ      decay includes
              resonant contributions in the D0p channel that are associated with intermediate excited
              Λ+ states, as well as contributions in the pπ− channel due to excited nucleon (N) states.
                c
              The study of the D0p part of the amplitude will help to constrain the dynamics of the
              Cabibbo-suppressed decay Λ0 → D0pK−, which is potentially sensitive to the angle γ
                                           b
              of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix [10,11]. The analysis of the
              D0p amplitude is interesting in its own right. One of the states decaying to D0p, the
                       +                                     ∗
              Λc(2940) , has a possible interpretation as a D N molecule [12–20]. There are currently
                                                                                   +
              no experimental constraints on the quantum numbers of the Λc(2940)     state.
                  The mass spectrum of the predicted and observed orbitally excited Λ+ states [21] is
                                                                                      c
                                                               +                     +              +
              shown in Fig. 1. In addition to the ground state Λc and to the Λc(2595)  and Λc(2625)
              states, which are identiﬁed as the members of the P-wave doublet, a D-wave doublet with
              higher mass is predicted. One of the members of this doublet could be the state known as
                           +                                              P       +
              the Λc(2880) , which is measured to have spin and parity J    =5/2 [22,23], while no
              candidate for the other state has been observed yet. Several theoretical studies provide
              mass predictions for this state and other excited charm baryons [21,24–29]. The BaBar
              collaboration has previously reported indications of a structure in the D0p mass spectrum
              close to threshold, at a mass around 2.84GeV1, which could be the missing member of
              the D-wave doublet [30].
                  This analysis is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity
              of 3.0fb−1 of pp collisions recorded by the LHCb detector, with 1.0fb−1 collected at
                                    √                             −1   √
              centre-of-mass energy   s = 7TeV in 2011 and 2.0fb     at  s = 8TeV in 2012.
                  The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 gives a brief description of the LHCb
              experiment and its reconstruction and simulation software. The amplitude analysis
              formalism and ﬁtting technique is introduced in Sec. 3. The selection of Λ0 → D0pπ−
                                                                                         b
              candidates is described in Sec. 4, followed by the measurement of signal and background
              yields (Sec. 5), evaluation of the eﬃciency (Sec. 6), determination of the shape of the
              background distribution (Sec. 7), and discussion of the eﬀects of momentum resolution
              (Sec. 8). Results of the amplitude ﬁt are presented in Sec. 9 separately for four diﬀerent
              regions of the Λ0 → D0pπ− phase space, along with the systematic uncertainties for those
                              b
              ﬁts. Section 10 gives a summary of the results.

                2 Detector and simulation
                The LHCb detector [31, 32] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the
                pseudorapidity range 2 < η < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or
                c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-
                strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip
                detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4Tm,
                and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of
                the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged
                particles with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at
                200GeV. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parame-
                ter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p )µm, where p is the component
                                                                             T                T
                of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Diﬀerent types of charged hadrons
                are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons,
                electrons and hadrons are identiﬁed by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad
                and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter.
                Muons are identiﬁed by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire
                proportional chambers.
                    The online event selection is performed by a trigger [33], which consists of a hardware
                stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software
                stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. At the hardware trigger stage, events
                are required to have a muon with high pT or a hadron, photon or electron with high
                transverse energy in the calorimeters. The software trigger requires a two-, three- or
                four-track secondary vertex with signiﬁcant displacement from any PV in the event. At
                least one charged particle forming the vertex must exceed a pT threshold in the range
                1.6–1.7GeV and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. A multivariate algorithm [34]
                is used for the identiﬁcation of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron.
                    In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia 8 [35] with a speciﬁc
                LHCb conﬁguration [36]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [37],
                in which ﬁnal-state radiation is generated using Photos [38]. The interaction of the
               3 Amplitude analysis formalism
               The amplitude analysis is based on the helicity formalism used in previous LHCb analyses.
               Adetailed description of the formalism can be found in Refs. [8,41,42]. This section gives
               details of the implementation speciﬁc to the decay Λ0 → D0pπ−.
                                                                     b
                                                             0        0    −
               3.1    Phase space of the decay Λ → D pπ
                                                             b
               Three-body decays of scalar particles are described by the two-dimensional phase space of
               independent kinematic parameters, often represented as a Dalitz plot [43]. For baryon
               decays, in general also the additional angular dependence of the decay products on the
               polarisation of the decaying particle has to be considered.
                  Avector of ﬁve kinematic variables (denoted Ω) describes the phase space of the decay
               Λ0 → D0pπ−. The kinematic variables are the two Dalitz plot variables, namely the
                 b
               invariant masses squared of the D0p and pπ− combinations M2(D0p) and M2(pπ−), and
               three angles that determine the orientation of the three-body decay plane (Fig. 2). These
               angles are deﬁned in the rest frame of the decaying Λ0 baryon with the xˆ axis given by
                                                                      b
               the direction of the Λ0 baryon in the laboratory frame, the polarisation axis zˆ given by
                                     b
               the cross-product of beam direction and xˆ axis, and the yˆ axis given by the cross-product
               of the zˆ and xˆ axes. The angular variables are the cosine of the polar angle cosϑp, and
               the azimuthal angle ϕ of the proton momentum in the reference frame deﬁned above
                                      p
               (Fig. 2(a)), and the angle ϕ     between the D0π− plane and the plane formed by the
                                            Dπ
               proton direction and the polarisation axis zˆ (Fig. 2(b)).
               3.2    Helicity formalism
               The baseline amplitude ﬁt uses the helicity formalism where the interfering amplitude
               components are expressed as sequential quasi-two-body decays Λ0 → Rπ−, R → D0p
                                                                                    b
               (where R denotes the intermediate resonant or nonresonant state). The decay amplitude
                                                           3
                for a Λ0 baryon with spin projection µ decaying via an intermediate state R with helicity
                        b
                λ into a ﬁnal state with proton helicity λ is
                where J      =1/2 and J are the spins of the Λ baryon and the R state, d                    (θ) are
                         Λb                R                           b                               λ1,λ2
                the reduced Wigner functions, and a          and b     are complex constants (couplings). The
                                                          λ         λp
                                                           R
                mass-dependent complex lineshape R(M2) deﬁnes the dynamics of the R decay. The
                angles deﬁning the helicity amplitude are the polar (θ ) and azimuthal (φ ) angles of
                                                                               R                      R
                the intermediate state R in the reference frame deﬁned above, and the polar (θp) and
                azimuthal (φp) angles of the ﬁnal-state proton in the frame where the intermediate state
                Ris at rest and the polar axis points in the direction of R in the Λ0 rest frame. All of
                                                                                              b
                these angles are functions of the ﬁve phase space variables Ω deﬁned previously and thus
                do not constitute additional degrees of freedom.
                    The strong decay R → D0p conserves parity, which implies that
                where J = 1/2, J = 0 and J are the spins of the proton, D0 meson and resonance R,
                         p           D            R
                respectively, and ηp = +1, ηD = −1 and ηR are their parities. This relation reduces the
                number of free parameters in the helicity amplitudes: |b | is absorbed by a             , and each
                                                                               λ                      λ

                To obtain the decay probability density, the amplitudes corresponding to diﬀerent po-
                larisations of the initial- and ﬁnal-state particles have to be summed up incoherently.
                The Λ0 baryons produced in pp collisions can only have polarisation transverse to the
                        b
                production plane, i.e. along the zˆ axis. The longitudinal component is forbidden due to
                parity conservation in the strong processes that dominate Λ0 production. In this case, the
                                                                                  b

                                  describe the probability density p(ω) of the decay. The density p(ω) is given by Eq. (5)

                                          Up to this point, the formalism has assumed that resonances are present only in
                                  the D0p channel. While in the case of Λ0 → D0pπ− decays the regions of phase space
                                                                                                                                   b
                                 with contributions from D0p and pπ− resonances are generally well separated, there
                                  is a small region where they can overlap, and thus interference between resonances in
                                  the two channels has to be taken into account. In the helicity formalism, the proton
                                  spin-quantisation axes are diﬀerent for the helicity amplitudes corresponding to D0p and
                                  pπ− resonances [8]: they are parallel to the proton direction in the D0p and pπ− rest
                                  frames, and are thus antiparallel to the π− and D0 momenta, respectively. The rotation
                                  angle between the two spin-quantisation axes is given by
                                 where p~(p) and p~(p) are the momenta of the π− and D0 mesons, respectively, in the proton

                                  expressed as
                                 where the angles θ , φ , θ                                       and φ are deﬁned in a similar way as θ , φ , θ                                                                     and φ , but
                                 with the intermediate state R in the pπ− channel.

                3.3     Resonant and nonresonant lineshapes
                The part of the amplitude that describes the dynamics of the quasi-two-body decay,
                R(M2), is given by one of the following functions. Resonances are parametrised with
                relativistic Breit–Wigner lineshapes multiplied by angular barrier terms and corrected by
                Blatt–Weisskopf form factors [45]:
                with mass-dependent width Γ(M) given by
                where m and Γ are the pole parameters of the resonance. The Blatt–Weisskopf form
                          R        0
                factors for the resonance, F (M,L ), and for the Λ0, F 0(M,L 0), are parametrised as
                where the deﬁnitions of the terms z(M) and z0 depend on whether the form factor for
                the resonance R or for the Λ0 is being considered. For R these terms are given by
                                                   b
                z(M)=p(M)d and z =p d, where p(M) is the centre-of-mass momentum of the decay
                                        0     0
                products in the two-body decay R → D0p with the mass of the resonance R equal to M,
                p ≡p(m ), and d is a radial parameter taken to be 1.5GeV−1. For Λ0 the respective
                  0        R                                                                      b
                functions are z(M) = q(M)d and z0 = q0d, where q(M) is the centre-of-mass momentum
                of decay products in the two-body decay Λ0 → Rπ−, q = q(m ), and d = 5.0GeV−1.
                                                                   b            0         R
                The analysis is very weakly sensitive to the values of d, and these are varied in a wide
                range for assessing the associated systematic uncertainty (Sec. 9.2).
                    The mass-dependent width and form factors depend on the orbital angular momenta
                of the two-body decays. For the weak decay of the Λ0, the minimum possible angular
                                                                              b
                momentum L 0 = J −1/2 (where J is the spin of the resonance) is taken, while for the
                                Λb
                strong decay of the intermediate resonance, the angular momentum LR is fully determined
                                                               LR+1
                by the parity of the resonance, P = (−1)            , and conservation of angular momentum,
                which requires LR = J ±1/2.
                    Twoparametrisationsareusedfornonresonantamplitudes: exponentialandpolynomial
                functions. The exponential nonresonant lineshape [46] used is
                where α is a shape parameter. The polynomial nonresonant lineshape [47] used is
                    where ∆M =M −M , and M is a constant that is chosen to minimise the correlations

                    between the coeﬃcients a when they are treated as free parameters. In the case of the
                                                         i
                    D0p amplitude ﬁt, M is chosen to be near the middle of the ﬁt range, M ≡ 2.88GeV.

                    In both the exponential and the polynomial parametrisations, M0 also serves as the
                    resonance mass parameter in the deﬁnition of p0 and q0 in the angular barrier terms. Note
                    that in Ref. [47] the polynomial form was introduced to describe the slow variations of
                    a nonresonant amplitude across the large phase space of charmless B decays, and thus
                    the parameters a were deﬁned as complex constants to allow slow phase motion over the
                                            i
                    wide range of invariant masses. In the present analysis, the phase space is much more
                    constrained and no signiﬁcant phase rotation is expected for the nonresonant amplitudes.
                    The coeﬃcients a thus are taken to be real.

                         Tostudy the resonant nature of the D0p states, model-independent parametrisations of
                    the lineshape are used. One approach used here consists of interpolation with cubic splines,
                    done independently for the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude (referred to as the
                    “complex spline” lineshape) [48]. The free parameters of such a ﬁt are the real Re(Ri)
                    and imaginary Im(R ) parts of the amplitude at the spline knot positions. Alternatively,
                                                  i
                    to assess the signiﬁcance of the complex phase rotation in a model-independent way, a
                    spline-interpolated shape is used in which the imaginary parts of the amplitude at all
                    knots are ﬁxed to zero (“real spline”).
                    3.4        Fitting procedure
                    An unbinned maximum likelihood ﬁt is performed in the two-dimensional phase space
                    ω =(M2(D0p),M2(pπ−)). Deﬁning L as the likelihood function, the ﬁt minimises
                    where the summation is performed over all candidates in the data sample and ptot is the
                    normalised PDF. It is given by
                    where p(ω) is the signal PDF, pbck(ω) is the background PDF, (ω) is the eﬃciency, and
                    N and N            are the signal and background normalisations:
                                  bck
                    and                                                        Z
                    where the integrals are taken over the part of the phase space D used in the ﬁt (Section 5),
                    and n        and n        are the numbers of signal and background events in the signal region,
                             sig         bck
                    respectively, evaluated from a ﬁt to the M(D0pπ−) invariant mass distribution. The
                    normalisation integrals are calculated numerically using a ﬁne grid with 400 × 400 cells
                    in the baseline ﬁts; the numerical uncertainty is negligible compared with the other
                    uncertainties in the analysis.
                                                                                  7
                3.5     Fit parameters and ﬁt fractions
                                                                     ±
                The free parameters in the ﬁt are the couplings a      for each of the amplitude components
                and certain parameters of the lineshapes (such as the masses and/or widths of the resonant
                states, or shape parameters of the nonresonant lineshapes). Since the overall normalisation
                of the density is arbitrary, one of the couplings can be set to unity. In this analysis,
                                  +                         +
                the convention a     ≡ 1 for the Λc(2880)      state is used. Additionally, the amplitudes
                corresponding to diﬀerent helicity states of the initial- and ﬁnal-state particles are added
                                                                     +       −
                incoherently, so that the relative phase between a     and a for one of the contributions is
                                                  −                        +
                arbitrary. The convention Im(a ) ≡ 0 for the Λc(2880)         is used.
                   The deﬁnitions of the polynomial and spline-interpolated shapes already contain terms
                that characterise the relative magnitudes of the corresponding amplitudes. The couplings
                for them are deﬁned in such a way as to remove the additional degree of freedom from
                the ﬁt. For the polynomial and real spline lineshapes, the following couplings are used:
                                                +      iφ      −            iφ
                                               a =re +, a =(1−r)e −,                                       (19)
                where r, φ+ and φ− are free parameters. For the complex spline lineshape, a similar
                parametrisation is used with φ+ ﬁxed to zero, since the complex phase is already included
                in the spline deﬁnition.
                   The observable decay density for an unpolarised particle in the initial state does not
                allow each polarisation amplitude to be obtained independently. As a result, the couplings
                 ±
                a in the ﬁt can be strongly correlated. However, the size of each contribution can be
                characterised by its spin-averaged ﬁt fraction
                If all the components correspond to partial waves with diﬀerent spin-parities, the sum
                of the spin-averaged ﬁt fractions will be 100%; otherwise it can diﬀer from 100% due to
                interference eﬀects. The statistical uncertainties on the ﬁt fractions are obtained from
                ensembles of pseudoexperiments.
                3.6     Evaluation of ﬁt quality
                                                        2
                To assess the goodness of each ﬁt, a χ value is calculated by summing over the bins of the
                two-dimensional Dalitz plot. Since the amplitude is highly non-uniform and a meaningful
                χ2 test requires a certain minimum number of entries in each bin, an adaptive binning
                method is used to ensure that each bin contains at least 20 entries in the data.
                   Since the ﬁt itself is unbinned, some information is lost by the binning. The number of
                                              2
                degrees of freedom for the χ test in such a case is not well deﬁned. The eﬀective number
                of degrees of freedom (ndfeﬀ) should be in the range Nbins −Npar −1 ≤ ndfeﬀ ≤ Nbins −1,
                where N      is the number of bins and N        is the number of free parameters in the ﬁt.
                         bins                                par
                For each ﬁt, ndfeﬀ is obtained from ensembles of pseudoexperiments by requiring that the
                probability value for the χ2 distribution with ndf       degrees of freedom, P(χ2,ndf ), is
                                                                      eﬀ                                 eﬀ
                distributed uniformly.
                                                               8
                  Note that when two ﬁts with diﬀerent models have similar binned χ2 values, it does
              not necessarily follow that both models describe the data equally well. Since the bins in
              regions with low population density have large area, the binning can obscure features that
              could discriminate between the models. This information is preserved in the unbinned
              likelihood. Thus, discrimination between ﬁt models is based on the diﬀerence ∆lnL, the
              statistical signiﬁcance of which is determined using ensembles of pseudoexperiments. The
              binned χ2 serves as a measure of the ﬁt quality for individual models and is not used to
              discriminate between them.
              4 Signal selection
              The analysis uses the decay Λ0 → D0pπ−, where D0 mesons are reconstructed in the ﬁnal
                                           b
              state K−π+. The selection of Λ0 candidates is performed in three stages: a preliminary
                                              b
              selection, a kinematic ﬁt, and a ﬁnal selection. The preliminary selection uses loose criteria
              on the kinematic and topological properties of the Λ0 candidate. All tracks forming a
                                                                   b
              candidate, as well as the Λ0 and D0 vertices, are required to be of good quality and be
                                         b
              separated from every PV in the event. The separation from a PV is characterised by a
                         2                                          2
              quantity χ , deﬁned as the increase in the vertex-ﬁt χ when the track (or combination
                         IP
              of tracks corresponding to a short-lived particle) is included into the vertex ﬁt. The tracks
              forming a D0 candidate are required to be positively identiﬁed as a pion and a kaon, and
              the Λ0 and D0 decay vertices are required to be downstream of their production vertices.
                    b
              All of the tracks are required to have no associated hits in the muon detector.
                  For candidates passing this initial selection, a kinematic ﬁt is performed [49]. Con-
              straints are imposed that the Λ0 and D0 decay products originate from the corresponding
                                             b
              vertices, that the Λ0 candidate originate from its associated PV (the one with the smallest
                                 b
                        2           0                              0
              value of χ   for the Λ ), and that the mass of the D candidate be equal to its known
                        IP          b
              value [23]. The kinematic ﬁt is required to converge with a good χ2, and the mass of
              the Λ0 candidate after the ﬁt is required to be in the range 5400–5900MeV. To suppress
                    b
              background from charmless Λ0 → pK−π+π− decays, the decay time signiﬁcance of the D0
                                           b
              candidate obtained after the ﬁt is required to be greater than one standard deviation. To
              improve the resolution of the squared invariant masses M2(D0p) and M2(pπ−) entering the
              amplitude ﬁt, the additional constraint that the invariant mass of the D0pπ− combination
              be equal to the known Λ0 mass [23] is applied when calculating these variables.
                                       b
                  After the initial selection, the background in the region of the Λ0 → D0pπ− signal is
                                                                                 b
              dominated by random combinations of tracks. The ﬁnal selection is based on a boosted
              decision tree (BDT) algorithm [50,51] designed to separate signal from this background.
              Theselection is trained using simulated Λ0 → D0pπ− events generated uniformly across the
                                                      b
              phase space as the signal sample, and the sample of opposite-ﬂavour D0pπ−, D0 → K+π−
              combinations from data as background. In total, 12 discriminating variables are used in
              the BDT selection: the χ2 of the kinematic ﬁt, the angle between the momentum and the
              direction of ﬂight of the Λ0 candidate, the χ2 of the Λ0 and D0 vertex ﬁts, the lifetime
                                        b                           b
                                   0                                0             2
              signiﬁcance of the D candidate with respect to the Λ vertex, the χ     of the ﬁnal-state
                                                                    b             IP
              tracks and the D0 candidate, and the particle identiﬁcation (PID) information of the
              proton and pion tracks from the Λ0 vertex. Due to diﬀerences between simulation and
                                                 b
              data, corrections are applied to all the variables from the simulated sample used in the
              BDTtraining, except for the PID variables. These corrections are typically about 10%
                                                         9
               and are obtained from a large and clean sample of Λ0 → Λ+π− decays. The simulated
                                                                     b     c
               proton and pion PID variables are replaced with values generated using distributions
               obtained from calibration samples of D∗+ → D0π+ and Λ+ → pK−π+ decays in data.
                                                                           c
               For these calibration samples, the four-dimensional distributions of PID variable, pT, η
               and the track multiplicity of the event are described using a nonparametric kernel-based
               procedure [52]. The resulting distributions are used to generate PID variables for each
               pion or proton track given its pT, η and the track multiplicity in the simulated event.
                  The BDT requirement is chosen such that the fraction of background in the signal
               region used for the subsequent amplitude ﬁt, |M(D0pπ−)−m(Λ0)| < 30MeV, does not
                                                                                b
               exceed 15%. This corresponds to a signal eﬃciency of 66% and a background rejection of
               96% with respect to the preliminary selection. After all selection requirements are applied,
               fewer than 1% of selected events contain a second candidate. All multiple candidates are
               retained; the associated systematic uncertainty is negligible.
               5 Fit regions and event yields
               The Dalitz plot of selected events, without background subtraction or eﬃciency correction,
               in the signal D0pπ− invariant mass range deﬁned in Sec. 4 is shown in Fig. 3(a). The
               part of the phase space near the D0p threshold that contains contributions from Λ∗+
                                                                                                     c
               resonances is shown in Fig. 3(b). The latter uses M(D0p) as the horizontal axis instead
               of M2(D0p).
                  In Fig. 3, the four amplitude ﬁt regions of the Λ0 → D0pπ− phase space are indicated.
                                                                  b
               These are denoted regions 1–4. Region 1, M(D0p) > 3GeV and M(pπ−) > 2GeV,
               is the part of the phase space that does not include resonant contributions and is
               used only to constrain the nonresonant pπ− amplitude in the D0p regions. Region 2,
                            0                                                   +
               2.86 < M(D p) < 2.90GeV, contains the well-known Λc(2880)           state and is used to
                measure its parameters and to constrain the slowly varying amplitude underneath it in a
                model-independent way. The ﬁt in region 3 near the D0p threshold, M(D0p) < 2.90GeV,
                provides additional information about the slowly-varying D0p amplitude. Finally, the ﬁt
                in region 4, M(D0p) < 3.00GeV, which includes the Λ (2940)+ state, gives information
                                                                           c
                about the properties of this resonance and the relative magnitudes of the resonant and
                nonresonant contributions. Note that region 2 is fully contained in region 3, while region
                3 is fully contained in region 4.
                   The signal and background yields in each region are obtained from extended unbinned
                maximum likelihood ﬁts of the D0pπ− invariant mass distribution in the range 5400–
                5900MeV. The ﬁt model includes the signal component, a contribution from random
                combinations of tracks (combinatorial background) and the background from partially
                reconstructed Λ0 → D∗0pπ− decays (where D∗0 decays into D0π0 or D0γ and the π0 or γ
                                b
                are not included in the reconstruction).
                   The signal component is modelled as the sum of two Crystal Ball functions [53] with
                the same most probable value and power-law tails on both sides. All parameters of the
                model are ﬁxed from simulation except for the peak position and a common scale factor
                for the core widths, which are ﬂoated in the ﬁt to data. The combinatorial background is
                parametrised by an exponential function, and the partially reconstructed background is
                described by a bifurcated Gaussian distribution. The shape parameters of the background
                distributions are free parameters of the ﬁt.
                   The results of the ﬁt for candidates in the entire D0pπ− phase space are shown in
                Fig. 4. The background and signal yields in the entire D0pπ− phase space, as well as in
                the regions used in the amplitude ﬁt, are given in Table 1.
                                                              11
               6 Eﬃciency variation over the Dalitz plot
               Thesamesampleofsimulatedeventsasintheselectiontraining(Sec.4)isusedtodetermine
               the variation of the eﬃciency across the Dalitz plot. The sample is generated uniformly
                                                                                     4  0       0   −
               in the decay phase space and consists of approximately 8 × 10 Λb → D pπ                events
               satisfying the selection requirements. Each simulated event is assigned a weight, derived
               from control samples of data, to correct for known diﬀerences in track reconstruction
               and hardware trigger eﬃciency between data and simulation. Since the PID variables in
               the sample are replaced by those generated from calibration data, the eﬃciency of PID
               requirements is included in the eﬃciency calculation and does not need to be treated
               separately.
                   The Dalitz plot eﬃciency proﬁle is calculated separately for two disjoint sets of
               candidates, deﬁned according to whether the hardware trigger was activated by one of
               the Λ0 decay products or by other particles in the event. For each of those samples, a
                     b
               kernel-based density estimation procedure with a correction for boundary eﬀects [52] is
               used to obtain a description of the relative eﬃciency as a function of the Dalitz plot
               variables. The overall eﬃciency is then given by the average of the two proﬁles, weighted
               according to the ratio of yields of the two classes of events in data. The resulting proﬁle
               is shown in Fig. 5(a). The normalisation of the eﬃciency proﬁle used in the amplitude ﬁt
               likelihood (Eqs. (15) and (16)) does not aﬀect the result. The eﬃciency proﬁle shown in
               Fig. 5(a) is normalised such that the average eﬃciency over the phase space is equal to
               unity.
               7 Background distribution
               Background in the vicinity of the Λ0 → D0pπ− invariant mass peak is dominated by
                                                       b
               randomcombinationsofD0 mesons, proton, and pion tracks. To determine the background
               shape as a function of Dalitz plot variables M2(D0p) and M2(pπ−), the Λ0 mass sidebands
                                                                                           b
               are used: 5500 < M(D0pπ−) < 5560MeV and 5680 < M(D0pπ−) < 5900MeV. The same
               procedure is applied to the opposite-ﬂavour D0pπ− sample to verify that the background
               shape in the mass sidebands is representative of that in the signal window. Good agreement
               is found.
                   The background distribution as a function of the Dalitz plot variables is estimated

                   8 Eﬀect of momentum resolution
                   Finite momentum resolution smears the structures in the Dalitz plot. The use of the
                   kinematic ﬁt with Λ0 and D0 mass constraints signiﬁcantly improves the resolution near

                   the edges of the phase space, but less so in the central region. The only structure in
                   the Λ0 → D0pπ− amplitude that is expected to be aﬀected by the ﬁnite resolution is the
                          b
                                           +
                   resonance Λc(2880) , which has a natural width of approximately 6MeV. Therefore, only
                   the M(D0p) resolution is considered, and is obtained from a sample of simulated events by
                   comparing the generated and reconstructed values of M(D0p). The width of the resolution
                   function at M(D0p) = 2.88GeV is 1.1MeV, i.e. signiﬁcantly smaller than the natural
                                               +
                   width of the Λc(2880) . However, simulation shows that neglecting the resolution would
                                                         +                                                      0
                   lead to a bias on the Λc(2880)           width of about 10%. Therefore, the M(D p) resolution is
                   taken into account in the ﬁt by convolving the signal PDF with a Gaussian resolution
                   function, where the width of the Gaussian is a function of M(D0p).
                                                                          13
               9 Amplitude analysis
               The amplitude ﬁt is performed in the four phase space regions deﬁned in Fig. 3. This
               approach has been chosen instead of performing the ﬁt to the entire Dalitz plot since
               the amplitude contains many unexplored contributions. The full ﬁt would include too
               many degrees of freedom and a very large range of systematic variations would need to be
               considered. Instead, the ﬁt is ﬁrst performed around the well-known resonance Λ (2880)+
                                                                                                  c
               and then the ﬁtting region is gradually extended to include a larger portion of the phase
               space.
               9.1    Fit in the nonresonant region
               The ﬁt in region 1, where no signiﬁcant resonant contributions are expected, provides
               constraints on the high-mass behaviour of the pπ− amplitude, and thus on the pπ−
               partial waves in the D0p ﬁt regions. The ﬁt model includes four exponential nonresonant
               components (Eq. (13)) in each of the D0p and pπ− spectra, corresponding to the four
               combinations of spin (1/2 and 3/2) and parity (negative and positive). Since there is no
               reference amplitude with known parity in this region, there is an ambiguity: all parities
               can be reversed simultaneously without changing the amplitude. The shape parameters α
               of all eight nonresonant components are varied in the ﬁt.
                   The projections of the ﬁtted data are shown in Fig. 6. The ﬁtted pπ− amplitude is
               extrapolated into the regions 2–4 of the Λ0 → D0pπ− phase space using the ﬁtted helicity
                                                          b
               distributions. The estimated contributions of the pπ− nonresonant components in the
               D0p mass regions are given in Table 2 and compared with the total numbers of signal
               events in those regions. They amount to less than 1% of the signal yield for the regions
               2 and 3, and around 1.5% for region 4. Therefore, the baseline ﬁt models for regions 2
               and 3 do not include pπ− crossfeed (although it is taken into account as a part of the
               uncertainty due to modelling of nonresonant amplitudes), while for region 4 the pπ−
               nonresonant component is included in the model. Since only a small part of the pπ−
               helicity distribution enters the D0p ﬁt region, the spin and parity assignment of the pπ−
                                                                                         P       −
               amplitude should have a very small eﬀect. Thus only one partial wave (J     =1/2 ) of the
               nonresonant pπ− component is included for the D0p amplitude ﬁt.
               9.2    Fit in the region of Λc(2880)+
               Next, an amplitude ﬁt is performed in region 2, in the vicinity of the well-established
                        +
               Λc(2880)   resonance. The quantum numbers of this state have been measured by the
                                                           14
                                            P        +                                                       0
                Belle collaboration to be J   =5/2 [22,23]. The ﬁt probes the structure of the wide D p
                amplitude component underneath the Λ (2880)+ peak using the shape of the latter as a
                                                           c
                                           +
                reference. Other Λc(2880)     spin assignments from 1/2 to 7/2 are also tried (spin 7/2 was
                not tested in the Belle analysis [22]). Since the amplitude is not sensitive to the absolute
                                                                         +
                parities of the components, the parity of the Λc(2880)      is always ﬁxed to be positive; the
                parities of the other amplitude components are determined relative to its parity.
                   As for region 1, the nonresonant amplitude model consists of four contributions with
                spins 1/2 and 3/2 and both parities. The nonresonant components are parametrised either
                with the exponential model of Eq. 13 (“Exponential”), or the amplitude with both real
                and imaginary parts varying linearly in M2(D0p) (“Linear”, which is a special case of the
                                                                                                              +
                spline-interpolated shape with only two knots). The mass and width of the Λc(2880)
                state are free parameters.
                                                         +
                   The model in which the Λc(2880)         has spin 5/2 is preferred for both nonresonant
                models, while the diﬀerence between exponential and linear models is negligible. The
                model with spin 5/2 and linear nonresonant amplitude parametrisation is taken as the
                baseline. Table 3 gives the diﬀerences in lnL compared to the baseline, along with the
                χ2 values and the associated probabilities. The quality of the ﬁt is obtained using the
                adaptive binning approach with at least 20 data entries in each bin and with the eﬀective
                number of degrees of freedom ndfeﬀ obtained from pseudoexperiments. The results of the
                ﬁt with the baseline model are shown in Fig. 7.
                   Argand diagrams illustrating the amplitude and phase motion of the ﬁt components
                are shown in Fig. 8. The plots contain a hint of phase rotation for the JP = 3/2+ partial
                wave in a counter-clockwise direction, consistent with the resonance-like phase motion
                observed in the near-threshold ﬁt (Sec. 9.3). The statistical signiﬁcance of this eﬀect is
                studied with a series of pseudoexperiments where the samples are generated according
                to the ﬁt where the complex phase in all the nonresonant components is constant. Each
                is ﬁtted with two models, with the complex phase constrained to be the same for both
                endpoints, and ﬂoated freely. The distribution of the logarithmic likelihood diﬀerence
                ∆lnLbetween the two ﬁts is studied and compared to the value obtained in data. The
                                                              15
                study shows that around 55% of the samples have ∆lnL greater than the value observed
                in data (1.4), i.e. this eﬀect is not statistically signiﬁcant with the data in region 2 alone.
                   Ensembles of pseudoexperiments, where the baseline model is used both to generate
                and to ﬁt samples of the same size as in the data, are used to validate the statistical
                   uncertainties obtained from the ﬁt, check for systematic biases due to the ﬁtting procedure,
                   evaluate the statistical uncertainties on the ﬁt fractions, and obtain the eﬀective number
                                                                                                               2
                   of degrees of freedom for the ﬁt quality evaluation based on a binned χ measure.
                       The unbinned maximum likelihood ﬁt is unbiased only in the limit of a large data
                   sample; in general a ﬁt to a ﬁnite sample can exhibit a bias that is usually signiﬁcantly
                   smaller than the statistical uncertainty. Pseudoexperiments are used to evaluate and
                                                                                                     +
                   correct for such biases on the mass and the width of the Λc(2880)                    state, as well as on the
                   ﬁt fractions of the amplitude components obtained from the ﬁt. The corrected values are
                   The uncertainties are statistical only. Correlations between the ﬁt parameters do not
                   exceed 20%. Since all the amplitude components have diﬀerent quantum numbers, the
                   interference terms cancel out after integrating over the phase space, and the sum of
                                                                          17
              uncorrected ﬁt fractions is exactly 100%. After the bias correction is applied individually
              for each ﬁt fraction, statistical ﬂuctuations in the corrections lead to a small, statistically
              not signiﬁcant, diﬀerence from 100% (in this case, the sum of ﬁt fractions increases to
              102.6%).
                                                                                   +
                  Anumber of experimental systematic uncertainties on the Λc(2880)   mass and width
              and on the diﬀerence ∆lnL between the baseline (5/2) and the next-best (7/2) spin
              assignments are considered and are given in Table 4. These arise from:
                 1. Uncertainty on the background fraction in the signal region (Sec. 5). The statistical
                    uncertainty is obtained from the ﬁt to the M(D0pπ−) distribution, and a systematic
                    uncertainty arising from the modelling of the signal and background M(D0pπ−)
                    distributions is estimated by performing ﬁts with modiﬁed M(D0pπ−) models. The
                    sum in quadrature of these contributions is taken as the systematic uncertainty.
                 2. Uncertainty on the eﬃciency proﬁle (Sec. 6). The statistical uncertainty is evaluated
                    via a bootstrapping procedure [54]. The uncertainty related to the kernel density
                    estimation procedure is obtained by varying the kernel size. The uncertainty due
                    to diﬀerences between data and simulation in the input variables of the BDT is
                    estimated by varying the scaling factors for these variables. In addition, the replace-
                    ment of simulated proton and pion PID variables with values drawn from control
                    samples in the data with matching kinematics, described in Section 4, introduces
                    further systematic uncertainties. The uncertainty associated with the limited size of
                    these control samples is evaluated again with a bootstrapping procedure, and the
                    uncertainty associated with the kinematic matching process is assessed by changing
                    the kernel size in the nonparametric algorithm used to estimate the PID response
                    as a function of the kinematic properties of the track.
                 3. Uncertainty on the background shape (Sec. 7). This is assessed by varying the
                    density estimation procedure (changing the number of Gaussian cores in the mixture
                    model, or using kernel density estimation instead of a Gaussian mixture model),
                    and by using only a narrower upper sideband of the M(D0pπ−) distribution, 5680 <
                    M(D0pπ−) < 5780MeV. The statistical uncertainty due to the ﬁnite size of the
                    background sample is estimated by bootstrapping.
                 4. Uncertainty on the momentum resolution (Sec. 8). This is estimated by varying the
                      2   0                                                              +
                    M (D p) resolution by 15%. It mainly aﬀects the width of the Λc(2880)  resonance.
                 5. Uncertainties on the mass scale. Due to the constraints on the hadron masses,
                    the momentum scale uncertainty of the detector has a negligible eﬀect on the ﬁt.
                    However, the uncertainties on the assigned mass values themselves do contribute. For
                    M(D0p)amplitudes the dominant contribution comes from the D0 mass uncertainty.
                 6. Uncertainty on the ﬁt procedure itself. This is assessed by ﬁtting ensembles of
                    pseudoexperiments, where the baseline amplitude model is used for both generation
                    and ﬁtting, and the number of events generated for each pseudoexperiment is equal
                    to the number of events in the data sample. The mean value for each ﬁtted parameter
                    is used as a correction for ﬁtting bias, while the statistical uncertainty on the mean
                    is taken as the uncertainty due to the ﬁt procedure.
                                                        18
                The uncertainties on the D0 mass and the ﬁt procedure do not aﬀect the signiﬁcance of
                the quantum number assignment and are thus not included in ∆lnL uncertainty.
                   Also reported in Table 4 is the uncertainty related to the amplitude model. It
                consists of two contributions, corresponding to the uncertainties in the modelling of the
                                   +
                resonant Λc(2880)     shape and the nonresonant amplitudes. The model uncertainties
                are asymmetric, and the positive and negative uncertainties for the two components are
                combined in quadrature separately to obtain the total model uncertainty.
                                                                                                  +
                   The uncertainty due to the Breit–Wigner parametrisation of the Λc(2880)          amplitude
                is estimated by varying the radial parameters r 0 and r           + between 0 and 10GeV−1
                                                                  Λ        Λ (2880)
                                                                    b       c
                and 0 and 3GeV−1, respectively, and by removing the angular barrier factor from the
                Breit–Wigner amplitude. The maximum deviation is taken as the uncertainty.
                   The uncertainty due to the modelling of the nonresonant amplitudes is estimated by
                taking the diﬀerence between the ﬁt results obtained with the default linear nonresonant
                model and the alternative exponential model. The possible crossfeed from the pπ− channel
                                             P        −                         −
                is estimated by adding a J      =1/2 component in the pπ channel to the amplitude.
                This component has a ﬁxed exponential lineshape with shape parameter α = 0.5GeV−2
               (obtained in the ﬁt to region 1 data) and its complex couplings are free parameters in the
                ﬁt.
                   Thehelicity formalism used to describe the amplitudes is inherently non-relativistic. To
                assess the model uncertainty due to this limitation, an alternative description is obtained
                with covariant tensors using the qft++ framework [55], but it is much more expensive from
                a computational point of view and is therefore not used for the baseline ﬁts. Diﬀerences
                between the helicity and the covariant formalism are mainly associated with the broad
                amplitude components and are therefore treated as a part of the uncertainty due to the
                nonresonant model. Although this contribution is included in the nonresonant model
                uncertainty in Table 4, it is also reported separately.

               hypothesis J = 7/2 for the Λc(2880) state is evaluated with a series of pseudoexperiments,
               where the samples are generated from the model with J = 7/2 and then ﬁtted with both
               J = 5/2 and 7/2 hypotheses. The diﬀerence of the logarithmic likelihoods ∆lnL is
               used as the test statistic. The distribution in ∆lnL is ﬁtted with a Gaussian function
               and compared to the value of ∆lnL observed in data. The statistical signiﬁcance is
               expressed in terms of a number of standard deviations (σ). The uncertainty in ∆lnL due
               to systematic eﬀects is small compared to the statistical uncertainty; combining them in
               quadrature results in an overall signiﬁcance of 4.0σ. The ﬁts with spins 1/2 and 3/2 for

               the Λc(2880)   state yield large ∆lnL and poor ﬁt quality, as seen from Table 3. These
               spin assignments are thus excluded.
                                                                     +
                  In conclusion, the mass and width of the Λc(2880)     resonance are found to be

               These are consistent with the current world averages, and have comparable precision. The
               preferred value for the spin of this state is conﬁrmed to be 5/2, with a signiﬁcance of 4σ
               over the next most likely hypothesis, 7/2. The spin assignments 1/2 and 3/2 are excluded.
                                                                             +
               Thelargest nonresonant contribution underneath the Λc(2880) state comes from a partial
               wave with spin 3/2 and positive parity. With a larger dataset, it would be possible to
               constrain the phase motion of the nonresonant amplitude in a model-independent way
                                  +
               using the Λc(2880)   amplitude as a reference.
               9.3    Fit in the near-threshold region
               Extending the M(D0p) range down to the D0p threshold (region 3), it becomes evident
               that a simple model for the broad amplitude components, such as an exponential lineshape,
               cannot describe the data (Fig. 9). The hypothesis that an additional resonance is present
               in the amplitude is tested in a model-dependent way by introducing a Breit–Wigner
               resonance in each of the D0p partial waves. Model-independent tests are also performed
               via ﬁts in which one or more partial waves are parametrised with a spline-interpolated
               shape. The results of these tests are summarised in Table 5. The mass and width of the
               Λ (2880)+ state are ﬁxed to their known values [23] in these ﬁts.
                c
                  There are no states with mass around the D0p threshold (2800MeV) that are currently
               known to decay to the D0p ﬁnal state. A broad structure has been seen previously in
                    + + −                                                 +
               the Λc π π   ﬁnal state that is referred to as the Λc(2765)   [56]. It could contribute to
               the D0p amplitude if its width is large. Since neither the quantum numbers nor the
               width of this structure have been measured, ﬁts are carried out in which this structure is
                                                                                    ±        ±
               included, modelled as a Breit–Wigner amplitude with spin-parity 1/2    or 3/2 , and with
               a width that is free to vary; its mass is ﬁxed to 2765MeV. In addition, four exponential
               nonresonant components with JP = 1/2+, 1/2−, 3/2+, and 3/2− are included. None of
               these ﬁts are of acceptable quality, as shown in Table 5. A Flatt´e parametrisation of the
               line shape [57] with couplings to Λ+π+π− and D0p channels is also considered, but does
                                                  c
               not produce a ﬁt of acceptable quality either. Therefore, a resonance with a ﬁxed mass of
               2765MeV is not suﬃcient to explain the data.
                  If the mass of the Breit–Wigner resonance is allowed to vary in the ﬁt, good agreement
                                                                            P        +
               with data can be obtained for the spin-parity assignment J     =3/2 . Moreover, if the
                                                          20
                     resonance is assumed to have JP = 3/2+, the exponential nonresonant component with
                     JP = 3/2+ can be removed from the amplitude model without loss of ﬁt quality. This
                     model is taken as the baseline for this ﬁt region. The mass and the width of the resonance
                     obtained from the ﬁt are around 2856MeV and 65MeV, respectively, and therefore this
                                                                               +
                     structure will be referred to as Λc(2860)                    hereafter. The results of this ﬁt are shown in
                     Fig. 10.
                          One model-independent test for the presence of structure in the broad component is
                     to describe the real and imaginary parts with spline-interpolated shapes. Cubic splines
                     with six knots at D0p masses of 2800, 2820, 2840, 2860, 2880 and 2900MeV are used.
                     Of the models where only one partial wave is described by a spline while the others
                     remain exponential, the best ﬁt is again given by the model where the spline-interpolated
                                           P           +                                                +
                     amplitude has J          =3/2 . TheArganddiagramfor the 3/2 amplitude in this ﬁt is shown
                     in Fig. 11(a). Each of the points numbered from 0 to 5 corresponds to one spline knot
                     at increasing values of M(D0p). Note that knots 3 and 5 at masses 2860 and 2900MeV
                     correspond to the boundaries of the region 2 where the nonresonant amplitude is described
                     by a linear function (Sec. 9.1) and that the amplitudes and phases in those two knots
                     can be compared directly to Fig. 8, since the convention is the same in both ﬁts. The

                     constant in phase. Note that the absolute phase motion cannot be obtained from this ﬁt
                     since there are no reference amplitudes covering the entire D0p mass range used in the ﬁt.

                     in this ﬁt is shown in Fig. 11(b). Since the phase rotates clockwise, this solution cannot
                     be described by a single resonance.
                          Agenuine resonance has characteristic phase motion as a function of M(D0p). As
                     a null test, the ﬁts are repeated with a spline function with no phase motion. This is
                     implemented as a real spline function multiplied by a constant phase. The ﬁts where only
                     one partial wave is replaced by a real spline give poor ﬁts. If both spin-3/2 amplitudes are
                     represented by real splines, the ﬁt quality is good, but the resulting amplitudes oscillate as
                     functions of M(D0p), which is not physical. Figure 12(a) shows the real spline amplitudes
                                                                                  21

              while Fig. 12(b) shows the M(D0p) projection of the decay density for this solution.

                  As in the case of the amplitude ﬁt in the Λc(2880)      region, pseudoexperiments
              are used to validate the ﬁt procedure, obtain uncertainties on the ﬁt fractions, and
              determine values of ndfeﬀ for the binned ﬁt quality test. Pseudoexperiments are also
              used to obtain the ∆lnL distributions for ﬁts with various spin-parity hypotheses. After

              ﬁt in the Λc(2880)   region (Sec. 9.2) and are summarised in Table 6. An additional
              contribution to the list of systematic uncertainties is the uncertainty in the knowledge of

              with the parametrisation of the nonresonant components is estimated by performing ﬁts

                  systematic uncertainties are included, these reduce to 8.4σ, 6.2σ and 6.4σ. For JP = 3/2+,
                  the following parameters are obtained for the near-threshold resonant state:
                      Thelargest uncertainties are associated with the modelling of the nonresonant components

               excluded either.

               systematic variations from Table 9 that can aﬀect the signiﬁcance of the quantum number
               assignment are considered. Since the cases with exponential and polynomial nonresonant
               amplitudes are treated separately, the model uncertainty associated with the nonresonant
               amplitudes does not include the diﬀerence between these two models.

               ensembles of pseudoexperiments and shown in Table 12. The column marked “Statistical”
