I. INTRODUCTION
Hadrons containing a b or c quark are referred to as heavy-quark hadrons and 
provide an interesting laboratory for studying and testing quantum 
chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions [1, 2]. Because the 
strong coupling constant αs is large for interactions involving small momentum 
transfer, masses and decay widths of the heavy-quark states cannot be 
calculated within the framework of perturbative QCD. As a result, many 
different approaches have been developed, for example, based on heavy-quark 
effective theory (HQET) [3], nonrelativistic and relativistic potential models 
[4], or lattice QCD [5].
In the limit of HQET, heavy-quark mesons, comprised of one heavy and one light 
quark, are the closest analogy to the hydrogen atom, which provided important 
tests of quantum electrodynamics. Heavy-quark baryons, comprised of one heavy 
and two light quarks, extend the hydrogen atom analogy of HQET by treating the 
two light quarks as a diquark system. This leads to degenerate spin-1/2 states 
resulting from the combination of a spin0, or a spin-1, light diquark with the 
heavy quark, and thus represents a complementary situation compared to 
heavy-quark mesons. Measurements of the mass spectrum and spin splittings of 
heavy-quark baryons are important for validating the theoretical techniques, 
and build confidence in their predictions for other heavy flavor studies. In 
this paper, we measure the properties of heavyquark baryons that contain 
a c quark, namely the resonances Λc(2595)+, Λc(2625)+, Σc(2455)++,0 , and Σc 
(2520)++,0. For simplification, we refer to Σ++,0 c as Σc wherever this 
information is not crucial. Throughout the paper, the use of a specific 
particle state implies the use of the charge-conjugate state as well. The quark 
model predicts the Λc (2595)+ and Λc (2625)+ , referred to as Λ∗+ c , to be the 
lowest orbital excitations of the Λc + groundstate with a spin-0 light diquark. 
The two Σc resonances are expected to have no orbital excitation and a spin-1 
light diquark.
Some theoretical predictions of the resonance masses are summarized in Table I, 
where Ref. [6] uses lattice QCD, Refs. [7–9] are based on the quark model, Ref. 
[10] employs QCD sum rules and Ref. [11] uses a bag model. There are a few 
calculations that predict the Σc (2455) natural width in the region of 1–3 
MeV/c2 [12–17] and the Σc (2520) width to be about 18 MeV/c2 [17]. No 
predictions are available for the Λc (2595) + and Λc(2625)+ widths. 
Experimental observation of all four states studied here and measurements of 
some of their properties have been reported earlier [19–26]. We list the world 
average masses and widths in Table II, omitting Σ+ c states, which are 
difficult to reconstruct with the CDF II detector due to the inefficiency in π0 
identification. For Σc (2455), many measurements exist with most of the 
information coming from CLEO [19] and FOCUS [20]. Experimental information on 
the Σc (2520) states comes exclusively from CLEO [21, 22] and it is worth 
noting that the two measurements of the Σc (2520)++ mass are inconsistent. For 
Λc (2595)+ and Λc (2625)+ three experiments have contributed, namely ARGUS 
[23], E687 at Fermilab [24, 25] and CLEO [26], all of which suffer from rather 
small data samples. In addition, Blechman and co-authors [27] showed that 
a more sophisticated treatment of the mass line shape, which takes into account 
the proximity of the Λc (2595)+ mass to the sum of the masses of its decay 
products, yields a Λc (2595) + mass which is 2–3 MeV/c2 lower than the one 
observed. The Σc (2455) and Σc(2520) decay directly to Λ+ c π, whereas the 
Λc(2595)+ and Λc(2625)+ end mainly in a Λ+ c ππ final state with dominating 
decays through intermediate Σc resonances. Therefore, these four resonances 
contribute to each other’s background, which requires a dedicated cross-feed 
background modeling in each case. p K In − this π + decays analysis, produced 
we exploit in app̄ large collisions sample at of Λ √ c + s → = 1.96 TeV and 
collected by the CDF II detector. Measurements of the masses and widths of the 
charmed baryons are performed through fits to the reconstructed mass 
distributions calculated from the momenta of the final state tracks. We take 
into account all expected cross-feeds and threshold effects. The paper is 
organized as follows. In Sec. II we briefly describe the CDF II detector and 
the trigger components important for this analysis. Secs. III and IV describe 
the candidate reconstruction and selection, respectively. In Sec. V we explain 
the fits involved in the measurements, followed by a discussion of systematic 
uncertainties in Sec. VI. Finally the results and conclusions are presented in 
Sec. VII.

II. CDF II DETECTOR AND TRIGGER
Among the components and capabilities of the CDF II detector [28], the tracking 
system is the one most relevant to this analysis. It lies within a uniform, 
axial magnetic field of 1.4 T strength. The inner tracking volume up to 
a radius of 28 cm is comprised of 6–7 layers of double-sided silicon microstrip 
detectors [29]. An additional layer of single-sided silicon is mounted directly 
on the beam-pipe at a radius of 1.5 cm, allowing excellent resolution on the 
impact parameter d0 , defined as the distance of closest approach of the track 
to the interaction point in the plane transverse to the beam line. The silicon 
detector provides a vertex resolution of approximately 15 μm in the transverse 
and 70 μm in the longitudinal direction. The remainder of the tracking volume 
from a radius of 40 to 137 cm is occupied by an open-cell drift chamber (COT) 
[30], providing a transverse momentum resolution of σ(pT )/p2 T ≈ 0.1%/(GeV/c). 
Hadron identification, which is crucial for distinguishing slow kaons and 
protons from pions, is achieved by a likelihood combination of information from 
a time-of-flight system (TOF) [31] and ionization energy loss in the COT. This 
offers about 1.5σ separation between kaons, or protons, and pions. 
A three-level trigger system is used for the online event selection. The most 
important device for this analysis at level 1 is the extremely fast tracker 
(XFT) [32]. It identifies charged particles using information from the COT and 
measures their transverse momenta and azimuthal angles around the beam 
direction. The basic requirement at level 1 is two charged particles with 
transverse momentum, pT , greater than 2 GeV/c. At level 2, the silicon vertex 
trigger [33] adds silicon hit information to the XFT tracks, thus allowing the 
precise measurement of impact parameters of tracks. The two level 1 tracks are 
required to have impact parameters between 0.1 and 1 mm and to be consistent 
with coming from a common vertex displaced from the interaction point by at 
least 100 μm in the plane transverse to the beam line. The level 3 trigger is 
implemented in software and provides the final online selection by confirming 
the first two trigger-level decisions using a more precise reconstruction 
similar to the offline software. This trigger is designed to collect hadronic 
decays of long-lived particles such as b and c hadrons. As determined by 
a study of the impact parameter distributions, the sample of charmed baryons 
recorded by the trigger consists of approximately equal contributions from Λb 
decays and direct cc production.

III. DATA SET AND RECONSTRUCTION
The analysis is performed on a data set collected by the CDF II detector at the 
Tevatron pp̄ collider between February 2002 and June 2009 corresponding to an 
integrated luminosity of 5.2 fb−1. The data were accumulated using the 
displaced two track vertex trigger described in the previous Section. The 
offline reconstruction of candidates starts with refitting tracks using pion, 
kaon and proton mass hypotheses to properly take into account differences in 
the multiple scattering and ionization energy loss. In the second step, three 
tracks, one with pion, one with kaon, and one with proton mass hypotheses, are 
combined to form a Λ+ c candidate. The three tracks are subjected to 
a kinematic fit that constrains them to originate from a common vertex. We 
require that the proton and pion candidates have the same charge and that the 
total charge of all three tracks is ±1. To construct Σc (2455) and Σc (2520) 
candidates we combine each Λ+ c candidate with one of the remaining tracks in 
the event using a pion mass hypothesis. The Λc (2595)+ and Λc(2625)+ candidates 
are obtained by combining each Λ+ c candidate with all possible oppositely 
charged track pairs taken from the remaining tracks in the event using the pion 
mass hypothesis for each of them. The tracks forming each baryon candidate are 
subjected to a kinematic fit that constrains them to originate from a common 
point. In each step of the reconstruction, standard quality requirements on 
tracks and vertices are used to ensure well-measured masses and 
decay-positions. We use simulated events to estimate the detector mass 
resolutions of the charmed baryons studied here. The decays are simulated by 
means of the evtgen package [34], where the Λ + c is forced to decay into pK 
− π + with its resonance structure taken into account. Afterwards, the 
generated events are passed through the detector simulation and then 
reconstructed by the same software used for data.

IV. CANDIDATE SELECTION
The selection of the candidates is done in two steps. In each one we first 
impose some quality requirements to suppress the most obvious background. For 
the surviving candidates we use a neural network to distinguish signal from 
background. Since all final states feature a Λ+ c daughter, the first step is 
the Λc + selection. In the second step, we perform a dedicated selection of the 
four states under study. All neural networks are constructed with the 
NeuroBayes package [35, 36] and trained, only using data, by means of the sPlot 
technique [37, 38]. This technique assigns a weight to each candidate 
proportional to the probability that the candidate is signal. The candidate 
weight is based on the discriminating variables, which are required to be 
independent of the ones used in the neural network training. In our case, the 
discriminating variable is the invariant mass of the candidate. In the 
training, each candidate enters with a weight calculated from the signal 
probability that is derived from its mass. Based on these weights, the neural 
network can learn the features of signal and background events. Since we use 
only data for the neural network trainings, we randomly split each sample into 
two parts (even and odd event numbers) and train two networks. Each of them is 
then applied to the complementary subsample in order to maintain a selection 
which is trained on a sample independent from the one to which it is applied. 
This approach avoids a bias of the selection originating from statistical 
fluctuations possibly learnt by the network. Additionally, using candidates 
from two different mass regions populated by background only for the training, 
we verify that the network selection does not depend on the mass or create an 
artificial excess in the spectrum.

A. Λ+ c selection
The Λ+ c → pK − π + candidates are required to decay to a proton with pT > 1.9 
GeV/c and other particles with pT > 400 MeV/c. The displacement of the 
associated secondary vertex, projected onto the Λ+ c transverse momentum 
direction, to the beam, Lxy , is required to be greater than 0.25 mm. In 
addition, we use particle identification information from the TOF and dE/dx 
from the COT. We combine the two sources of information for each track t into 
a single variable where the index P i j=π,K,p denotesfj the PdE/dx hypothesis 
(t)PT OF of (t) the particle type. The PT i OF (t) is the probability to 
observe the measured time-of-flight given a particle of type i, and PdE/dx 
i (t) is the probability to observe the measured dE/dx. The fractions fj are fπ 
= 0.7, fK = 0.2, and fp = 0.1, as estimated from TOF information of a generic 
background sample. We apply the requirement LLp > 0.6 on the proton track and 
LLK > 0.2 on the kaon track. In case TOF or dE/dx information is not available 
for a given track, we do not impose the corresponding requirement. The mass 
distribution of the candidates with even event numbers is shown in Fig. 1. 
A fit with a Gaussian signal and a linear background function defines the 
probability density functions (PDFs) used to calculate the s Plot weights for 
the Λ+ c network training. The corresponding distribution of odd-numbered 
events is similar. The full list of input quantities of the neural network, 
sorted by their importance, can be found in Table III. In the table, d0 denotes 
the impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex of the pp̄ interaction 
for a track in the plane transverse to the beam direction, σd0 its uncertainty, 
χ 2 (Λ+ c ) the quality of the kinematic fit of the Λ+ c candidate, and 
cos(∢(Λ+ c , t)) the cosine of the angle between the momentum of the Λ+ 
c candidate in the lab frame and the momentum of the proton or kaon track in 
the Λ+ c rest frame. These angles carry information about the resonant 
substructure of the decay Λ+ c → pK − π+ . To demonstrate the ability of the 
neural network to classify signal and background, the mass distributions of Λ+ 
c candidates with even event numbers before and after requiring their neural 
network output to correspond to an a posteriori signal probability greater than 
2.5% is shown in Fig. 2. This requirement leads to a background reduction of 
32% while keeping 97% of the signal. We use the output of the Λ+ c neural 
network as input to the neural networks for selecting the Σc and Λ ∗+ 
c resonances.

B. Σc (2455) and Σ c (2520) selection
The Σc (2455)++,0 and Σc (2520)++,0 → Λ+ c π +,− selection starts with the 
application of a few loose requirements to remove the most obvious background, 
followed by the use of a neural network. We require the a posteriori signal 
probability of the Λ+ c neural network to be greater than 2.5% (see Fig. 2), 
the pT (π) of the added pion to be greater than 400 MeV/c, d0 (π) < 1.5 mm, and 
the mass of the Λ+ c candidate to be within ±10 MeV/c 2 of the nominal Λ+ 
c mass [18], 2276.46 < M (pK −π +) < 2296.46 MeV/c2 (see Fig. 2). These 
requirements are common for both neutral and doubly-charged states. The mass 
difference + ∆M + = − M (Σc ) − M (Λ+ c ) distributions of all the Λ+ c π and 
Λc π candidates are shown in Fig. 3. In the ∆M definition, M (Σc) and M (Λ+ 
c ) correspond to the reconstructed masses of the Σc and Λ+ c candidates. The 
neural network for the final selection of the Σc (2455) and Σc (2520) 
candidates uses five input quantities. Ordered by their importance, these are 
the output of the Λ + c neural network N N (Λ + c ), the proper decay time of 
the Σc candidate t(Σc ) = (Lxy (Σc ) · M (Σc))/(c · pT (Σc)), the quality of 
the kinematic fit of the Σc candidate χ 2 (Σc), the uncertainty of the Σc 
impact parameter in the transverse plane σd0 (Σc ), and the impact parameter in 
the transverse plane of the pion from the Σc decay d0(π). Independent neural 
networks are employed for Σ++ c and Σ0 c . The training itself is performed 
using candidates in the mass difference region from 155 to 180 MeV/c2 
. Although this includes only Σc (2455) candidates, it is applied to select Σc 
(2520) candidates as well. The s Plot weights are determined by a fit to the ∆M 
distribution with a Gaussian function for the signal and a linear function for 
the background PDF. We choose the threshold on the output of the Σc neural 
network to maximize S/√S + B, where S is the number of signal Σc events and 
B is the number of background events in ∆M between 162.3 and 172.3 MeV/c2. The 
S and B yields are derived from a fit to the ∆M distribution which uses 
a Gaussian function for the signal and a linear function for the background and 
covers the ∆M range used for the neural network training. The resulting neural 
network output requirement is the same for both charge combinations and 
corresponds to an a posteriori signal probability of the neural networks 
greater than 10%. The ∆M distributions of the selected candidates are shown in 
Fig. 3.

C. Λc (2595)+ and Λc (2625)+ selection
+ The + initial − step of the Λc(2595)+ and Λc(2625)+ → Λc π π selection 
requires the a posteriori signal probability of the Λ+ c neural network to be 
greater than 2.5%, 2276.46 < M (pK − π+) < 2296.46 MeV/c2 (see Fig. 2), pT (π) 
of both added pions to be greater than 400 MeV/c, and the impact parameter of 
the object constructed from the two additional pions to be d0(π+ π− ) < 1.0 mm. 
The mass difference ∆M = M (Λ∗+ c ) − M (Λc +) distribution is shown in Fig. 4. 
We use the ∆M region between 327 and 357 MeV/c2 for the neural network 
training. Although this includes only Λc (2625)+ candidates, it is applied to 
select Λc (2595)+ candidates as well. The s Plot weights are based on a fit to 
the ∆M distribution with a Gaussian function for the signal and a linear 
function for the background PDF. The neural network uses four inputs. Ordered 
by their importance, these are the quality of the Λ∗+ c kinematic fit χ2 (Λc 
∗+), the uncertainty of the impact parameter of the combined two-pion object 
σd0 (π+π − ), the output of the Λ + c neural network N N (Λc +), and the proper 
decay time of the Λ∗+ c candidate t(Λ∗+ c ). We choose the requirement that 
maximizes S/√ S + B, corresponding to an a posteriori signal probability of the 
neural network greater than 12.5%. The S and B yields are derived from a fit to 
the ∆M distribution using a Gaussian function for the signal and a linear 
function for the background, where we consider events in the region 336.7 < ∆M 
< 346.7 MeV/c2. The resulting mass difference distribution after the final 
requirements is shown in Fig. 4.

V. FIT DESCRIPTION
To determine the mass differences relative to the Λ+ c and the widths of the 
six studied states, we perform binned maximum likelihood fits to three separate 
mass difference distributions. The first two are Λ+ c π + and Λc + π − , where 
the states Σc (2455) ++,0 and Σc (2520)++,0 are studied. The last one is 
Λ c + π+ π− for Λc (2595)+ and Λc(2625)+ . In the case of the Σc states, part 
of the background comes from Λ∗+ c decays and thus has different properties 
compared to the combinatorial background. On the other hand, when fitting Λ∗+ 
c states, there is a background contribution from random Σ++,0 c π−,+ com
binations which have a threshold close to the Λc(2595)+ state. The negative 
logarithm of the likelihood function has a general form of where ~a are the 
free parameters, J is the number of bins in the histogram of the corresponding 
mass difference distribution, nj is the number of entries in bin j, and μj is 
the expected number of entries in bin j. The values μj are obtained using the 
function where s1 (∆M ) and s2 (∆M ) are the PDFs for the two signals, b(∆M 
) is the background function and Ni are the corresponding numbers of events. 
All three PDFs depend on a subset of the free parameters ~a. The function is 
evaluated at the bin center to calculate the expectation for μj . While the 
general structure is the same in all three fits, the PDFs are specific to Σc 
and Λ∗+ c states.

A. Σc (2455) and Σc (2520) fit
In each of the two distributions we need to parametrize two signals and several 
background components. We use a 150–320 MeV/c2 range to avoid complications 
arising from the description of the steep rise of the background at threshold. 
Both Σc(2455) and Σc (2520) are described by a nonrelativistic Breit-Wigner 
function, convolved with a resolution function. The resolution function itself 
is parametrized by three Gaussians with mean zero and the other parameters 
derived from simulated events. The average width of the resolution function is 
about 1.6 MeV/c2 for Σc(2455)++,0 and about 2.6 MeV/c2 for Σc (2520)++,0. For 
illustration, the simulated Σc (2520)0 mass resolution is shown in Fig. 5. We 
introduce a single common scaling factor s for the widths of all three 
Gaussians to correct for a possible mismatch in our mass resolution estimate. 
This scaling factor is allowed to float within a Gaussian constraint in the 
fit, what corresponds to adding
with μ = 1 and σ = 0.2, reflecting a 20% uncertainty on the mass resolution 
(see Sec. VI), to the negative logarithm of the likelihood. Three different 
types of background are considered, namely, random combinations without real Λ+ 
c , combinations of real Λ+ c with a random pion, and events due to the decay 
of Λ∗+ c to Λ+ c π+ π− . The random combinations without a real Λ+ c dominate 
and are described by a second-order polynomial with shape and normalization 
derived in a fit to the ∆M distribution from the Λ+ c mass sidebands 2261.46 
< M (pK − π + ) < 2266.46 MeV/c2 and 2306.46 < M (pK − π+ ) < 2311.46 MeV/c2 
. In the Σc fit, this contribution is allowed to float within a Gaussian 
constraint implemented by the addition of to the negative logarithm of the 
likelihood, where V is the covariance matrix of the fit to the ∆M distribution 
from the Λ+ c mass sidebands and ∆ ~ is the vector of parameters of the 
second-order polynomial. The fits to the distributions from the Λ+ c mass 
sidebands can be found in Fig. 6. The difference between doubly-charged and 
neutral spectra is due to D∗ (2010)+ → D0 0 π+ mesons with multibody D0 decays, 
where not all D decay products are reconstructed. In order to describe this 
reflection, an additional Gaussian function is used. The second background 
source consisting of real Λ+ c combined with a random pion is modeled by 
a third-order polynomial, where all parameters are left free in the fit. The 
background originating from Λ∗+ c decays is described using theoretical 
considerations. With good approximation, there are two states that contribute, 
namely Λc(2595)+ and Λc (2625) + , decaying into a Λ+ c π+ π− final state. The 
Λc(2595)+ decays dominantly to a Σc π final state [18] and thus contributes 
mainly to the signal. We therefore neglect its contributions to the backgrounds 
in the Λc π distributions. On the other hand, the Λc (2625)+ decay is 
dominantly nonresonant [18]. To model it, we start from a flat Λ+ 
c π + π − Dalitz plot and project it on the appropriate axis. Since the shape 
of the projection depends on the reconstructed Λc(2625)+ → Λ+ c π+ π − mass, we 
use ten different values of this mass and weight their contribution according 
to the Λc (2625)+ shape we obtain from our fit to the Λ+ c π + π − data. This 
contribution amounts to about 2% of the total background. The full fit to the 
∆M distribution, containing all signal and background components, can be found 
in Fig. 7. The χ2 value of the Σ++ c fit is 340 (324 degrees of freedom) and 
that of the Σ0 c fit is 384 (321 degrees of freedom).

B. Λc (2595)+ and Λc (2625)+ fit
The fit for Λ c(2595)+ and Λc (2625)+ includes two signals and several 
background components and is performed in a ∆M region from 290 to 400 MeV/c2. 
Previous measurements of the Λc (2595)+ properties indicate that it decays 
dominantly to the final state Σc π, with the threshold very close to the 
Λc(2595)+ mass [18]. This introduces an additional complication to the fit 
compared to the Σc case. Blechman et al. [27] showed that taking into account 
the mass dependence of the natural width yields a lower Λc (2595)+ mass 
measurement than observed by previous experiments. With the present event 
sample we are more sensitive to the details of the Λc(2595)+ line shape than 
previous analyses and include this dependence in the model. The Λc (2595)+ 
parametrization follows Ref. [27]. The state is described by a nonrelativistic 
Breit-Wigner function of the form where Γ(Λ+ c π+ π−) and Γ(Λc +π0π0) are the 
massdependent partial widths to the Λ+ c π+ π − and Λ+ c π 0 π 0 final states. 
Assuming that those two final states saturate nearly 100% of the Λc(2595)+ 
decay width, the sum in the denominator corresponds to the total width. The two 
partial widths are derived in Ref. [39] as
Here, fπ = 132 MeV/c2 is the pion decay constant [40], mΛ+ c is the world 
average Λ+ c mass, E1 ,E2 are the energies of the two pions in the rest frame 
of the Λc (2595)+, and ~1,~ p p2 are the corresponding momenta. Following Ref. 
[27], the coupling constant g2 is determined by the Σc decay width using the 
relation with mΣc being the world average mass of the Σc (2455) and ~pπ the 
momentum of the pion from the Σc (2455) decay to Λc π in the Σc (2455) rest 
frame. From the world average ΓΣc = 2.2 MeV/c2 [18] we obtain the value g2 
2 = 0.365 which is fixed in the fit. The amplitudes A, B, and C for the decays 
Λc (2595)+ → Σc (2455)0 π + , Λc(2595)+ → Σc (2455)++ π− , and Λc (2595)+ → Σc 
(2455)+ π0 are parametrized as
In these definitions, mΣ++,+,0 c and ΓΣ ++,+,0 c are the mass and the width of 
the Σc (2455)++,+,0 taken from Ref. [18]. The coupling constant h2 , defined in 
Ref. [16], is related to the decay width of the Λc(2595)+ and represents the 
actual quantity we measure instead of the natural width. This approach 
describes a purely S-wave decay, a possible D-wave contribution is assumed to 
be negligible and ignored. For illustration, we show the dependence of the two 
partial widths on M (Λc (2595)+ ) − M (Λ+ c ) in Fig. 8. The shape defined by 
Eq. 7 is then numerically convolved with a resolution function determined from 
simulation and consisting of three Gaussians with mean zero. The average width 
of the resolution function is about 1.8 MeV/c2 . As for the Σc case, we 
introduce a common, Gaussian constrained, scaling factor for the widths of all 
three Gaussians, in order to account for the uncertainty in the width of the 
resolution function. The signal PDF for the Λ c(2625)+ is the nonrelativistic 
Breit-Wigner function of Eq. 4 convolved with a three Gaussian resolution 
function determined from simulation, which has an average width of about 2.4 
MeV/c2 . Again, all three Gaussians have mean zero and a common, Gaussian 
constrained, scaling factor for their widths is introduced. The background 
consists of three different sources, which include combinatorial background 
without real Λ+ c , real Λc + combined with two random pions, and real Σc ++,0 
combined with a random pion. The combinatorial background without real Λ+ 
c is parametrized by a second-order polynomial whose parameters are deter
mined in a fit to the ∆M distribution of candidates from the Λ+ c mass 
sidebands, 2261.46 < M (pK −π +) < 2266.46 MeV/c2 and 2306.46 < M (pK − π+) 
< 2311.46 MeV/c2. This distribution is shown in Fig. 9 together with the fit. 
In the final fit, we keep the parameters for this background floating within 
a Gaussian constraint of the form of Eq. 6 to the values found in the fit to 
the candidates from the Λ+ c mass sidebands. The second source, consisting of 
real Λ+ c combined with two random pions, is parametrized by a second-order 
polynomial with all parameters allowed to float in the fit. The final source of 
background are real Σc combined with a random pion. For this source, the main 
issue is to have the proper shape close to the threshold. Small imperfections 
at higher ∆M can be ignored, as the second background source has enough 
flexibility to absorb it. The PDF of this Σc background is based on a constant 
function defined from the threshold to the end of the fit range. In order to 
take into account the natural widths as well as resolution effects, we use the 
weighted sum of ten such functions for both Σc (2455)++ and Σc (2455)0 . Their 
thresholds and weights are chosen according to the shapes derived in the Σc 
fits shown in Fig. 7. The size of this contribution is constrained to the Σc 
(2455) yield obtained from the fits to the M (Σc ) − M (pK −π+) 
− + distributions for 2 candidates with M (Λ∗+ c ) − M (pK π ) > 355 MeV/c 
. These two distributions together with the fits are shown in Fig. 10. The full 
fit to the ∆M distribution, containing all signal and background components, 
can be found in Fig. 11. The χ2 value of the fit is 227 (206 degrees of 
freedom). Compared to that, the χ2 value of a fit with a massindependent Λc 
(2595)+ decay width, shown in Fig. 12, increases to 286 (206 degrees of 
freedom).

VI. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES
We investigate several systematic effects that can affect the measurements. 
Generally, they can be categorized as imperfect modeling by the simulation, 
imperfect knowledge of the momentum scale of the detector, ambiguities in the 
fit model, and uncertainties on the external inputs to the fit. In this Section 
we discuss how they can affect our results and the way we assess them. 
A summary of the assigned uncertainties can be found in Tables IV–VI. To obtain 
the total systematic uncertainties, we add up the contributions from all 
sources in quadrature.

A. Mass resolution model
To properly describe the signal shapes, we need to understand the intrinsic 
mass resolution of the detector. Since we estimate this using simulated events, 
it is necessary to verify that the resolution obtained from simulation agrees 
with that in real data. We use D ∗(2010)+ → D 0 − π + with D 0 → K − π+ decays 
and ψ(2S) → J/ψ π+ π with J/ψ → μ+ μ− decays for this purpose. We compare the 
resolution in data and simulated events as a function of the p T of the pions 
added to D0 or J/ψ as well as the instantaneous luminosity. We also compare the 
overall resolution scale between data and simulated events and find that all 
discrepancies are less than 20%, which we assign as uncertainty on our 
knowledge of the resolution function. The contribution from this uncertainty is 
already included in the uncertainties on the resonance parameters determined by 
the default fit with Gaussian constraint on the resolution scaling factor s, 
the resulting values for which are listed in Table VII. These values are 
consistent with 1, indicating that the resolution is well understood within the 
assigned uncertainty. To disentangle it from the statistical component, we 
repeat the fits on data without multiplying the widths of the resolution 
function by the scaling factor s from Eq. 5. The systematic uncertainty due to 
the imperfect modeling of the resolution function is then obtained by the 
difference in quadrature of the uncertainty of the fit with and without the 
Gaussian constraint. This uncertainty in the resolution has a large impact on 
the natural widths, but a negligible effect on the mass differences.

B. Momentum scale
The accuracy of the momentum scale depends on the precision with which the 
magnetic field and the amount of material in the detector are known. Both 
effects are originally calibrated using J/ψ → μ+ μ− decays [41]. A limitation 
of this calibration is that it uses muons that are required by the detector 
acceptance to have pT > 1.5 GeV/c, while pions from Σc or Λ∗+ c decays 
typically have much lower pT . The estimate of the uncertainty on the mass 
differences comes from our previous work on the X(3872) hadron [42]. There, 
ψ(2S) → J/ψ π+ π − decays are used to study the momentum scale uncertainties by 
comparing the measured ψ(2S) mass with the world average value [18]. In 
addition, we study the ψ(2S) mass dependence on the kinematic properties of the 
pions, which constrains the sizes of possible effects. Furthermore, we verify 
the momentum scale by using D∗ (2010)+ → D0 π + decays, where the resulting 
deviation from the world average is far below the uncertainty derived from 
ψ(2S). Based on Ref. [42], we assign a 0.12 MeV/c2 uncertainty on the mass 
differences of all states under study due to the imperfect knowledge of the 
momentum scale. The corresponding effect on the natural widths was studied in 
our previous measurements of the masses and widths of the excited charmed meson 
states D1 0 and D2 ∗0 [43], and we assign the 0.2 MeV/c2 found there as the 
uncertainty on the natural widths due to this source. To translate this 
uncertainty to the coupling constant h2 , we assign it to the sum Γ(Λ+ c π+ π−) 
+ Γ(Λc + π0 π0) (see Eqs. 8 and 9), which is a function of h2 , and perform 
Gaussian error propagation.

C. Fit model
In terms of our fit model and procedure we check two effects, the internal 
consistency of the fit and the shape of the signal PDFs. We do not perform an 
explicit check of the background parametrizations as those are described by 
polynomials and any analytic function can be approximated by a polynomial of 
sufficient complexity. Since the fit quality does not indicate significant 
discrepancies between data and the model, we conclude that the degree of the 
polynomial functions used is sufficient. Some backgrounds are determined from 
independent sources, but as the appropriate parameters are Gaussian constrained 
in the fit, the uncertainty originating from the sample size of the external 
sources, like Λ+ c mass sidebands, is already included in the statistical 
uncertainties of the results. To check the internal consistency of the fit 
procedure, we generate a large ensemble of statistical trials using PDFs of our 
fit model with parameters obtained from the fit to data. Estimates of all 
physics parameters except the mass differences and natural widths of the Σc 
(2520) resonances are found to be unbiased. The Σc (2520) mass differences have 
small biases towards higher values and the Σc (2520) natural widths are biased 
towards lower values. These biases on the Σc(2520) resonance parameters result 
from the fairly low signal to background ratio and the flexibility in the 
background PDF, which tends to absorb the tails of the relatively broad signal 
structure. We repeat the study with a true value for the Σc (2520) natural 
width below (Γ = 7.5 MeV/c2) and above (Γ = 20 MeV/c2) the measured value and 
find that the biases have a small dependence on the true value. The biases are 
largest for a true value of the natural width of 20 MeV/c2 and we consequently 
assign these biases as systematic uncertainties on the mass differences and 
natural widths of the Σc (2520) states. Concerning the uncertainty on the 
signal shape, we check whether our signal parametrization using nonrelativistic 
Breit-Wigner functions provides a proper description. We refit the Σc and Λc 
(2625)+ data using a P -wave relativistic Breit-Wigner function of the form 
with where m = ∆M + mΛ+ c , R is the Blatt-Weisskopf radius set to 3 (GeV/c) −1 
[44, 45], m0 and Γ0 are the nominal mass and width, and q(q0 ) is the 
momentum of the daughters in the Σc or Λc (2625)+ rest frame calculated from 
the nominal mass. For the Λc (2595)+ we replace the nonrelativistic 
Breit-Wigner function of Eq. 7 by a relativistic one and use the variable width 
defined in Eqs. 8 and 9. For the Σc (2455) we observe a difference of 0.02 
MeV/c2 in the mass difference, which we assign as a systematic uncertainty. In 
the cases of Σc (2520) and Λ∗+ c resonances we do not observe any shift and 
conclude that the effect is negligible.

D. External inputs
Finally, the line shape of the Λc(2595)+ depends on the input values of the Σc 
(2455) masses and widths and the pion decay constant fπ . We repeat the fit 
using values of those parameters smaller or larger by 1 standard deviation 
and take the stronger variation as systematic uncertainty. The effect of the 
uncertainty on the world average Σc (2455) masses and widths used as input is 
dominant compared to the effect of the uncertainty on fπ .

VII. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We perform + fits to the − M (pK − π+ π+ ) − − M (pK + − π+ ), M (pK −π + π− 
) − M (pK π+ ), and M (pK π+ π π −) − M (pK −π ) mass difference distributions 
to obtain the desired resonance properties. The data distributions and fits are 
shown in Figs. 7 and 11. We select about 13800 Σc (2455)++, 15900 Σc (2455)0, 
8800 Σc (2520)++, 9000 Σc (2520)0, 3500 Λc (2595)+ , and 6200 Λc (2625)+ signal 
events. The resonance parameters obtained can be found in Table VIII. For the 
width of the Λ c(2625)+ we observe a value consistent with zero and therefore 
calculate an upper limit using a Bayesian approach with a uniform prior 
restricted to positive values. At the 90% credibility level we obtain Γ(Λc 
(2625)+ ) < 0.97 MeV/c2. For easier comparison to previous results [23, 26], 
h22 corresponds to a Λc (2595)+ decay width of Γ(Λc (2595)+) = 2.59 ± 0.30 
± 0.47 MeV/c2 , calculated at ∆M (Λ c(2595)+ ). Our precise measurement of the 
coupling constant h2 can, for instance, be used to predict the width of the Ξc 
(2645), as discussed in Ref. [46]. In Figs. 13–15, our results are compared to 
previous measurements by other experiments. Except for ∆M (Λc (2595)+ ), all 
our measurements agree with the previous world average values. For ∆M 
(Λc(2595)+) we show that a mass-independent natural width does not describe the 
data (see Fig. 12) and observe a value which is 3.1 MeV/c2 smaller than the 
existing world average. This difference is the same size as estimated in Ref. 
[27]. Since this data sample is 25 times larger than the ones studied so far, 
our results on the properties of Λ∗+ c states provide a significant improvement 
in precision compared to previous measurements. The precision for the Σc states 
is comparable to the precision of the world averages. Concerning the 
inconsistency of the two CLEO measurements [21, 22] of the Σc(2520)++ mass, our 
data favor a smaller value. In conclusion, we exploit the world largest samples 
of excited charmed baryons to measure the resonance parameters of six states, 
namely Σc(2455)++ , Σc(2455)0, Σc (2520)++, Σc (2520)0, Λc (2595)+ , and 
Λc(2625)+ . Table IX summarizes the results for their masses and widths. These 
measurements provide a significant improvement in the knowledge of the 
resonance parameters of the states and represent the first analysis of charmed 
baryons at a hadron collider.
