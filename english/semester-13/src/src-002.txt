Baryonic decays of B mesons, which contain a heavy
bottom quark and a light up or down quark, provide a
laboratory for a range of particle physics investigations:
trends in decay rates and baryon production mechanisms;
searches for exotic states such as pentaquarks and glue-
balls [1, 2]; searches for excited baryon resonances; ex-
amination of the angular distributions of B-meson de-
cay products to determine baryon spins; and measure-
ments of radiative baryonic B decays that could be sen-
sitive to new physics through flavor-changing neutral cur-
rents [3, 4]. The latter measurements rely on improving
our theoretical understanding of baryonic B decays in
general [5, 6].
The inclusive branching fraction for baryonic B decays
is (6.8 ± 0.6)% [7], and many exclusive baryonic B decay
modes have been observed [8]. If we order the measured
decays by Q-value:
Q = mB −
 X
  f
   mf ,
    (1)
    where mf is the mass of each daughter in the final state
    of the B decay, we find that for each type of baryonic
    B decay, the branching fractions decrease as the Q-value
    increases. The smallest measured branching fraction is of
    the order 10−6, which also corresponds to our experimen-
    tal sensitivity for measuring these branching fractions.
    Potentially interesting B-meson −
     decays such as B → pp,
     B → ΛΛ, and B → Λ+
      c Λc have not yet been seen.
      Theoretical approaches to calculating baryonic B de-
      cays include pole models [9, 10], diquark models [11],
      and QCD sum rules [12, 13]. Recently, theoretical cal-
      culations have focused on pole models, where the B de-

cay proceeds through an intermediate b-flavored baryon
state, which then decays weakly into one of the final state
baryons [14, 15]. However, it is not clear that the pole
model is reliable for baryon poles, and the predictions
given in the literature vary significantly. Perhaps the
most satisfying theoretical interpretation of baryonic B
decay rates is the qualitative one proposed by Hou and
Soni in 2001 [16], who argue that B decays are favored if
the baryon and antibaryon in the final-state configuration
are close together in phase space. A consequence is that
decay rates to two-body baryon-antibaryon final states
are suppressed relative to rates of three-body final states
containing the same baryon-antibaryon system plus an
additional meson. In the three-body case, the baryon and
antibaryon can be in the favored configuration—close to-
gether in phase space—rather than back-to-back as in
the two-body case.

                three-body decay provide insight into baryon production
                mechanisms. Additionally, the B − → Λ+
                 c pπ−
                  system is a
                  laboratory for studying excited baryon states and is used
                  to measure the spin of the Σc(2455)0 . This is the first
                  measurement of the spin of this state.
                  B A B AR DETECTOR AND DATA SAMPLE
                  The measurements presented in this paper are based on
                  383 × 10 6 Υ (4S) → BB decays recorded with the B A B AR
                  detector [18] at the PEP-II e+ e− asymmetric-energy B
                  Factory at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. At
                  the interaction point, 9- GeV electrons collide with 3.1-
                  GeV positrons at the Υ (4S) resonance with a center-of-
                  mass energy of 10.58 GeV/c2 .
                  Charged particle trajectories are measured by a five-
                  layer silicon vertex tracker (SVT) and a 40-layer drift
                  chamber (DCH) immersed in a 1.5-T axial magnetic field.
                  Charged particle identification is provided by ionization
                  energy (dE/dx) measurements in the SVT and DCH
                  along with Cherenkov radiation detection by an inter-

nally reflecting ring-imaging detector (DRC).
Exclusive B-meson decays are simulated with the
Monte Carlo (MC) event generator EvtGen [19]. Back-
ground continuum MC samples (e+ e− → qq, where
q = u, d, s, c) are simulated using Jetset7.4 [20] to
model generic hadronization processes. Background MC
samples of e+ e− → B + B − and B 0 B0 are based on simu-
lations of many exclusive B decays (also using EvtGen).
The large samples of simulated events are generated and
propagated through a detailed detector simulation using
the GEANT4 simulation package [21].
CANDIDATE SELECTION
We select candidates that are kinematically consistent
with 0
 B 0 +
  → Λ+
   c p and B −
    → Λc +
     +
      pπ−
       . For the decay mode
        +B → Λc 0 p, we reconstruct + Λc candidates in the pK −π ,
        pKS 0, pK S π+ π− , and Λπ decay modes, requiring the in-
        variant mass of each Λ+
         c candidate to be within 10 MeV/c
         2
         of the world average value [8]. For B −
          + → − Λc +
           +
            pπ −
             , we also
             reconstruct Λ+
              c candidates in the Λπ π π decay mode,
              and require all of the Λc +
               candidates to have an invariant
               mass within 12 MeV/c2 of the world average value.
               The p, K, and π candidates must be well-reconstructed
               in the DCH and are identified with likelihood-based par-
               ticle selectors using information from the SVT, DCH, and
               DRC.
               The KS 0 candidates are reconstructed from two oppo-
               sitely charged pion candidates that come from a common
               vertex; Λ candidates are formed by combining a proton
               candidate with an oppositely charged pion candidate that
               comes from a common vertex. The invariant mass of
               each KS 0 and Λ candidate must be within 10 MeV/c2 of
               the world average value [8] and the flight significance (de-
               fined as the flight distance from the Λ+
                c vertex in the x−y
                plane divided by the measurement uncertainty) must be
                greater than 2. The mass of each KS 0 and Λ candidate is
                then constrained to the world average value [8].
                A mass constraint is applied to all of the Λ+
                 c candi-
                 dates, and all Λ+
                  c
                   daughter
                    tracks
                     must
                      come
                       from
                        a com-
                        mon vertex. The Λ+
                         c
                          candidates
                           are
                            then
                             combined
                              with
                              an antiproton to form a B0 → Λ+

                               c
                                − candidate,
                                 +
                                  −
                                   or
                                    with
                                    an antiproton and a pion to form a B → Λ c pπ candi-
                                    date. The daughters of each B candidate must come from
                                    a common vertex, and the candidate with the largest χ2
                                    probability in each event is selected.
                                    Additional background suppression is provided by in-
                                    formation about the topology of the events. A Fisher
                                    discriminant [22] is constructed based on the absolute
                                    value of the cosine of the angle of the B candidate mo-
                                    mentum vector with respect to the beam axis in the e+ e−
                                    center-of-mass (CM) frame, the absolute value of the co-
                                    sine of the angle between the B candidate thrust axis [23]
                                    and the thrust axis of the rest of the event in the e+ e−
                                    CM frame, and the moments L0 and L2 . The quantity

j
respect Lj is defined to the as BP
 candidate i pi |cos θi thrust | , where axis θi of is the the ith angle charged
  with
  particle or neutral cluster in the rest of the event and pi
  is its momentum. The optimal maximum value of the
  Fisher discriminant is chosen separately for each Λ+
   c and
   B decay mode.
   Kinematic properties of B-meson pair production at
   the Υ (4S) provide further background discrimination.
   We define a pair of observables, mm and mr , that are
   uncorrelated and exploit these constraints:

The variable mm is based on the apparent recoil mass of
the unreconstructed B meson in the event, where qe+ e−
is the four-momentum of the e+e− system and q̂Λ+
 c p(π −
  )
  is the four-momentum of the reconstructed B candidate
  after applying a mass constraint. The variable m r is the
  difference between the unconstrained mass of the recon-
  structed B candidate and mB , the world average value
  of the mass of the B meson [8]. Signal events peak at
  mB in mm and 0 in mr . This set of variables was first
  used in [24] and is chosen as an uncorrelated alternative

            The event selection criteria are optimized based on
            studies of sideband data (in the region 0.10 < mr <
            0.20 GeV/c2 ) and simulated signal MC samples. The data
            in a signal region (approximately ±2σ wide in mm and
            mr ) were blinded until the selection criteria were de-
            termined and the signal extraction procedure was spec-
            ified and validated. B candidates that satisfy mm >
            5.121 GeV/c2 and |mr | < 0.10 GeV/c2 are used in the
            maximum likelihood fit.

DETECTION EFFICIENCY

 The −
detection efficiencies for B0 → Λ+
 c p and B
−
 →
Λc pπ signal events are determined from signal MC sam-
ples with 175, 000 to over 1, 600, 000 events in each sam-
ple, depending on the Λ+
 c decay mode. To account for
inaccuracies in the simulation of the detector, each MC
event is assigned a weight based on each daughter par-
ticle’s momentum and angle. These weights are deter-
mined from studies comparing large pure samples of pro-
tons, kaons, and pions in MC samples and data. Small
corrections (0.4 − 1.6%) are also applied to 0 account for
tracking inefficiencies due to the displaced KS and Λ ver-
tices. These corrections depend on the KS 0 and Λ daugh-
ter trajectories’ transverse momentum and angle, and the
distance between the beam spot and the displaced vertex.
The detection efficiency (εl ) for B 0 → Λ+
 c p signal
events in each Λ+
 c
 decay
 mode
 (l)
 is
 determined
 from
the number of signal events extracted from an extended
unbinned maximum likelihood fit to signal MC events.
These events pass the same selection criteria as applied
to data. The fit is performed in two dimensions, mm
and mr . The probability distribution function (PDF) for
the background consists of a threshold function [26] in
mm multiplied by a first-order polynomial in mr ; this is
the same as the background PDF used in the fit to the
B 0 → Λ +
 c p data. The signal PDF consists of a Gaussian
in mm multiplied by a modified asymmetric Gaussian
with a tail parameter in mr . The detection efficiencies in
each Λ +
 c decay mode are summarized in Table I.
The detection +
 efficiency for B − → Λ+
 c pπ
−
 signal
events in each Λc decay mode varies considerably across
the Dalitz plane of the three-body decay. For reference,
we quote the average efficiencies in Table I, but we ap-
ply a more sophisticated treatment to these events. We
parameterize the physical Dalitz region using the vari-
ables cos θh and the Λ+
 c π
−
 invariant mass, mΛc π . The
helicity angle θh is defined as the angle between the π −
and the p in the B − rest frame. The quantity cos θh can
be expressed in terms of Lorentz-invariant products of
four-vectors. We divide the kinematic region into rea-
sonably sized bins that are uniform in cos θh (0.2 units
wide) and nonuniform in mΛcπ (60 − 200 MeV/c2 wide).
This choice of variables is more conducive to rectangu-

lar bins than the traditional set of Dalitz variables. The
mΛcπ bins are narrower near the kinematic limits where
the efficiency changes more rapidly and are centered on
expected resonances. For B− → Λ+
 c pπ −
, Λc +
 → pK − π
 +
near cos θh = 0, the efficiency varies from approximately
13% at low mΛc π , to 16% in the central mΛc π region, to
8% at high mΛc π . The efficiency is fairly uniform with
respect to cos θh, except at cos θh ∼ 1 and low mΛcπ ,
where it drops to 7.4%. The other Λ+
 c decay modes ex-
hibit similar variations in efficiency.
SIGNAL EXTRACTION
To extract the number of signal events in data, a two-
dimensional (mm vs. mr ) extended unbinned maximum
likelihood fit is performed simultaneously across Λ+
 c de-
cay modes. B 0 → Λ+
 c p candidates and B
 −
 → Λ+
 c pπ
−
candidates are fit separately.
The background PDF for each fit is a threshold func-
tion [26] in mm multiplied by a first-order polynomial in
mr . The shape parameter (~sbkg ) of the threshold func-
tion is free but is common to all of the Λ+
 c decay modes.
The slope a of the first-order polynomial is allowed to
vary independently for each Λ+
 c decay mode.
The signal PDF is a single Gaussian distribution in
mm multiplied by a single Gaussian distribution in mr
for B 0 → Λ+
 c p and multiplied − by −
 a double Gaussian dis-
tribution in mr for B → Λ+
 c pπ . A single 0 Gaussian is
sufficient to describe the signal PDF for B → Λ+
 c p be-
cause of the small number of expected signal events. All
of the shape parameters of the signal PDF (~ssig ) are free
but are shared among the Λ+
 c decay modes. Separate sig-
nal (Nsig,l ) and background (Nbkg,l ) yields are extracted
for each Λ+
 c decay mode l.
The total likelihood is the product of the likelihoods

for each Λ+
 c decay mode:
 The symbol ~y represents the variables used in the 2-D fit,
{mm , mr }.
The full simultaneous fit is validated using independent
samples of signal MC events to simulate signal events and
toy MC samples (generated from the background MC
sample distribution) to represent background events in
the fit region. For both B 0 → Λ+
 c p and B
−
 → Λ +
 c pπ −
 ,
we perform fits to 100 combined MC samples and find
that the fit is robust and the results are unbiased.
The results of the 2-D fits to data are shown in projec-
tions of mm and mr for each Λ+
 c decay mode. Figure 1
shows the result of the fit to B 0 → Λ+
 − c p candidates −
 and
Fig. 2 shows the result of the fit to B → Λ+
 c pπ candi-
dates. The signal yields from the fits are summarized in
Table II.
BRANCHING FRACTION MEASUREMENTS
For the three-body mode B− → Λ+
 c pπ−
 , the efficiency
variation across the Dalitz plane requires a correction
for each signal event in order to extract the branching
fraction for this mode. We use the s Plot method [27] to
calculate a weight for each event e based on the 2-D fit
to the variables ~y . We have Ns = 2 species (signal and
background) for each Λ+
 c decay mode and define fj,k as
the signal (j, k = 1) or background (j, k = 2) PDF. The
s Plot weights are calculated as
s Pn eP k=1Nk  fk(~
ye)
where s ) is the s PNs
 weight for species n, VPn(~ye Plot is
the covariance matrix for signal and background yields,
fj,k (~ye ) is the value of PDF fj,k for event e, and ~ye is the
mm and mr value for event e. The elements of the inverse
of the covariance matrix V are calculated as follows:
 P
Ns
 k=1 N k f k(~
 ye )
2where the sum is over the N candidates. Note that in
the calculation of the covariance matrix, the data is refit
to the same simultaneous PDF described above, except
that all fit parameters other than the yields are fixed to
the values from the original fit.
We use these s Plot weights to generate a signal or
background distribution for any quantity that is not cor-
related with mm or mr . The s Plot formalism is easily
extended to incorporate an efficiency correction for each
candidate. Each candidate is assigned a weight of 1/ε,
where the efficiency ε for an event is determined by its
location in the cos θh vs. mΛc π plane.
The branching fraction for B 0 → Λ+
 c p for Λc +
 decay
mode l is calculated as follows:
where NBB is the number of BB events in the data sam-
ple and Rl is the ratio of −Λ+
 +
 c branching fraction for decay
mode 0 l to B(Λ+
 c → pK π − ), taking care to include the
KS → π+ π− and Λ → pπ branching fractions where
applicable.
+
 In order to determine the branching fraction for B− →
Λc pπ− , we take the product of the s Plot weight and effi-
ciency weight for each candidate and sum over all of the
candidates in the fit region. We simplify the notation by

for event i and include a 1% correction for the peaking
background due to B 0 → Σc +p, Σc + → Λ+

 :

The contribution from the peaking background is esti-
mated using the Λ+
 c → pK − π
+
 decay mode. Since the
overall branching fraction for the peaking background
contribution is the same regardless of Λ+
 c decay mode,
it is applied as a proportional correction. The measure-
ments +
 for B(B 0 → Λ c +

Λc decay mode are summarized in Table III.
The BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimate) technique
is used as described in Ref. [28] to combine the corre-
lated branching fraction measurements for different Λ+
 c
decay modes. The purpose of the method is to obtain
an estimate x̂ that is a linear combination of t individual

measurements (xl ), is unbiased, and has the minimum
possible variance σ̂2. The estimate x̂ is defined by
biased. The condition Each coefficient P
l αl = 1 αl ensures is a constant that the weight method for is mea-
 un-
surement xl and is not necessarily positive. The set of
coefficients α (a vector with t elements) is determined by
where U is a t-component vector whose elements are all
1 (UT is its transpose) and E is the (t × t) error matrix.
The diagonal elements of E are the individual variances,
σl 2 . The off-diagonal elements are the covariances be-
tween measurements (rσ l σl′ , where r is the correlation
between measurements l and l′ ). The error matrices add
linearly, so we define E = Estat + Esyst. Estat includes
the uncertainties in the fit yields and the correlations
between yields from the simultaneous fit result. Esyst in-
cludes the systematic uncertainties that are described in
the next section. Overall multiplicative constants (NBB
and B(Λ+
 c → pK −π +
)) that are common to all the mea-
surements and their uncertainties are not included in the
BLUE method.
The solutions for α are
and
where αT is the transpose of α. The order of the co-
efficients corresponds to the order of Λ+
 c decay modes
presented in Table III.
We calculate the best estimate x̂ according to Eqn. 8
and divide this quantity by NBB and B(Λ+
 c → pK − π+
 ).
We calculate the variance of x̂
Since the error matrices add linearly, we quote separate
statistical and systematic uncertainties. The statisti-
cal and systematic uncertainties in NBB are added in
quadrature with the statistical and systematic σ̂ results,
respectively. The combined branching fraction measure-
ments are thus
where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and
the uncertainty in B(Λ+
 c → pK −π +
 ), respectively.
We use the same procedure to determine the branching
ratio B(B− → Λ+
 c pπ −
)/B(B 0
 → Λc +
p):

In the branching ratio, many of the systematic uncer-
tainties, including the dominant B(Λ+
 c → pK −π +
) un-
certainty, cancel.
SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES IN THE
BRANCHING FRACTIONS
+
 The −
uncertainties in the B(B 0 → Λ+
 c p) and B(B
 −
 →
Λc pπ ) measurements are dominated by the uncertainty
in the Λ+
 c → pK −π
 +
 branching fraction, and then by
the uncertainties in the Λ+
 c branching ratios (compared
to Λ+
 c
 →
 pK
 − π
 +
 )
 [8].
The systematic uncertainties for each Λ+
 c decay mode
are summarized in Tables IV and V. The systematic
uncertainty in the number of BB events is 1.1%.
The uncertainty in the efficiency determination is due
to MC statistics, charged particle tracking, and particle
identification. For B0 → Λ+
 c p, the − uncertainty −
 due to MC
statistics is (0.4 − 0.6)%. For B → Λ+
 c pπ , we calculate
the uncertainty due to MC statistics by independently
varying the number of reconstructed signal MC events
in each cos θh , mΛc π bin according to a Poisson distribu-
tion (ensuring that the data events in the same bin are
correlated). The resulting uncertainty is (0.6 − 3.1)%.
The tracking efficiency systematic uncertainties are de-
termined from two separate studies. In the first study,
τ + τ − candidates are selected, in which one τ candidate
decays to leptons and the other decays to more than one
hadron plus a neutrino. Events are selected if one lepton
and at least two charged hadrons are reconstructed. The
efficiency is then measured for reconstructing the third
charged particle for the hadronic decay. From this study
there is a (0.38 − 0.45)% uncertainty in the tracking ef-
ficiency per charged particle. In the second method, a
charged particle trajectory is reconstructed in the SVT,
and then the efficiency for finding the corresponding tra-
jectory in the DCH is measured. For the latter study,
the uncertainties range from 0.21% to 1.18% depending
on the Λ+
 c decay mode. The systematic uncertainties
determined in the two studies are added in quadrature.
The systematic uncertainty for charged particle iden-
tification is a measure of how well the corrections ap-
plied to the events in the signal MC sample for the
efficiency − determination −

samples agree to within (0.8 − 3.5)% for different ranges
of momentum and angle.
Systematic uncertainties due to the fit procedure are
also considered. The dominant fit uncertainty is due
to the threshold function parameter in the background
PDF. The fit validation study showed that this param-
eter must be shared among Λ+
 c decay modes to ensure
fit robustness. We allowed this parameter to vary inde-
pendently among Λ +
 c decay modes and repeated the fit
to data; the difference between the fit results is taken as
a systematic uncertainty of (1 − 24)% depending on the
Λ+
 c decay mode. A peaking background due to misre-
constructed B 0 → Σc + p, Σc + → Λ+
 c π0
 events is present
at the level of 1.0%. We assign a systematic uncertainty
of 0.5% to account for the uncertainty in B(B 0 → Σc +p).
The nominal endpoint in the fit to mm is 5289.0 MeV/c2 ;
we vary this by ±0.5 MeV/c2 , resulting in a systematic
uncertainty of (0.2 − 1.5)%.
Λ+
 c p THRESHOLD ENHANCEMENT
The −
 kinematic features and resonances in B − →
Λ+
 c pπ are investigated through examination of the 2-D
Dalitz plot (m2 pπ vs. m2 Λc π ) and its projections (the res-
onances will be discussed in the next section). Using the
s Plot formalism, we project the events in the {mm , mr }
fit region using the signal s Plot weights and background
s Plot weights along with the efficiency corrections. This
method allows us to project only the features of the signal
events, while taking the efficiency variations into account.
Figure 3 shows the sPlot weights for mpπ
 2
 vs. m2 Λc π . Note
that the negative bins are suppressed in the 2-D Dalitz
plot.
We project the events in the fit region onto the mΛc p
axis with signal sPlot weights and efficiency corrections
to study the enhancement at threshold in the baryon-
antibaryon mass distribution. This enhancement can be
seen in B − → Λ+
 c pπ
 −
 decays as a peak in mΛcp near
the kinematic threshold, m0 Λc p = 3224.8 MeV/c2 . We di-
vide the normalized mΛc p distribution by the expectation
from three-body phase-space; the resulting distribution
is shown in Figure 4. An enhancement is clearly visi-
ble near threshold. The observation of this enhancement
is consistent with baryon-antibaryon threshold enhance-
ments as seen in other decay modes such as B → ppK,
B → Dpp(π), or in continuum e + e− → ppγ [1, 2].

RESONANT SUBSTRUCTURE OF B − → Λ +
 c pπ
 −
We also project the events in the fit region onto the
mΛcπ axis with signal sPlot weights and efficiency cor-
rections to study resonances in mΛcπ . We perform 1-D
binned 0 χ2 fits to discriminate − between −
 resonant (B− →
Σc p) and nonresonant (B → Λ+
 c pπ ) signal events.
In each binned χ2 fit, the PDF is numerically integrated
over each (variable-sized) bin and the following quantity
is minimized:
where Psig is the resonant signal PDF, Pnr is the nonres-
onant signal PDF, Ysig is the expected yield of weighted
resonant signal events, and Ynr is the expected yield of
weighted nonresonant signal events. We assume the am-
plitude and phase of the non-resonant B − → Λ+
 c pπ
 −
contribution is constant over the Dalitz plot, and does
not interfere with the resonant contributions. The range
of the integral over the quantity dmi takes into account
the variable bin width, Yi is the number of weighted
data events, and σi is the uncertainty in Yi . Variable
bin widths are used to ensure that there are a sufficient
number of signal events in each mΛc π bin so that the es-
timated uncertainty is valid. This is especially important
in the non-resonant sideband regions. Bin widths in the
signal regions are chosen to have sufficient granularity
throughout the resonant peaks.
The Σc (2455)0 and Σc (2520)0 are well-established res-
onances that decay to Λ+
 c π −
 . A third Σc resonance, the
Σc(2800)0
, was reported by the Belle Collaboration in
2005 [29] along with its isospin partners Σc(2800)+ and
Σc(2800)++ . These resonances were observed in con-
tinuum (e+ e− → cc) Λcπ events. The Σc (2800)0 reso-
nance was fit with a D-wave Breit-Wigner distribution
and the mass +

 which

 corresponds
to an absolute mass of (2802 − 7 ) MeV/c [8]. The nat-
ural width of the resonance is (61− + 28
 18) MeV [29]. We
search for evidence of all three resonances.
A significant Σc(2455)0
 signal is seen near threshold;
see Fig. 3 and Fig. 5. We construct a resonant signal PDF
from a non-relativistic S-wave Breit-Wigner distribution
convolved with the sum of two Gaussian distributions (to
form a “Voigtian” distribution). This quantity is multi-
plied by a phase-space function. The mass and (constant)
width of the resonance in the Breit-Wigner PDF are free
in the fit. The resolution (described by the two Gaus-
sians) is fixed; it is determined −
 +
 from − +
 a B − → Σc(2455)0p,
Σc (2455)0 → Λ+
 c π , Λc → pK π
 signal MC sample
by comparing the measured Σc (2455)0 mass to the true
Σc (2455)0 mass for each candidate. The two-body phase-
space function goes to zero at the kinematic threshold for
Λcπ: 2426.03 MeV/c2 . The non-resonant signal PDF is a
threshold function [26]; the threshold is set to the kine-
matic threshold for Λc π. The shape parameter for the
threshold function is fixed from a fit to a non-resonant
B− → Λ+
 c pπ
 −
 signal MC sample. The weighted data
points are shown in Fig. 5 with the fit overlaid; the fit
results are summarized in Table VI. The average effi-
ciency for Λ+
 c → pK − π+
 signal MC events in this region
is 14.1%.
No significant signal is seen in the region of the
Σc (2520)0; see Fig. 6. We perform a fit using a rela-
tivistic D-wave Breit-Wigner distribution with a mass-
dependent width to describe the resonant signal PDF,
fixing the resonance mass and the width to the world
average values [8]: mR = (2518.0 ± 0.5) MeV/c2 and
ΓR = (16.1 ± 2.1) MeV. The non-resonant signal PDF
is a first-order polynomial. We obtain Ysig = 27 ± 69
events; the fit result is shown in Fig. 6. The average effi-
ciency for Λ+
 c → pK − π+
 signal MC events in this region
is 15.4%.
In the mΛc π distribution, we also observe an excited
Σc 0 state that is higher in mass than the Σc(2520)0 . We
construct a resonant signal PDF from a relativistic Breit-
Wigner distribution with a mass-dependent width:

The quantity L is the angular momentum (L = 0, 1, 2 is
S-wave, P -wave, D-wave, respectively), q is the momen-
tum of the Λ+
 c (which is equal to the momentum of the
π− ) in the excited Σc 0 rest frame, and qR is the value
of q when mΛc π = mR. In Eqn. 16, BL ′ (q, qR ) is the
Blatt-Weisskopf barrier factor [8]:
where we define a constant impact parameter d = 1 fm
(the approximate radius of a baryon), which corresponds
to 5.1 GeV−1. Blatt-Weisskopf barrier factors are weights
that account for the fact that the maximum angular mo-
mentum (L) in a strong decay is limited by the linear
momentum (q). Since the resonance is quite wide, we do
not need to include a resolution function in the resonant
signal PDF. The two fit parameters (mR and ΓR) of the
Σc 0 are free in the fit. The non-resonant signal PDF is a
first-order polynomial.
From the 1-D binned χ2 fit, we obtain Ysig = 1449±284
efficiency-corrected events for the excited Σc 0 state. We
choose L = 2 for the nominal fit, but investigate L = 0, 1
as well. The average efficiency for Λ+
 c → pK − π
+
 signal
MC events in this region is 16.3%. The fit results are
summarized in Table VII and shown in Fig. 7. The χ2
from the fit is 37 with 31 degrees of freedom (DOF). If
the signal yield is fixed to zero and the mean and width
are fixed to the central values from the nominal fit, the
resulting χ2 is 78 with 34 DOF. The significance can be
calculated from ∆χ2 = 40.9, which is equivalent to 5.8σ
for the joint estimation of three parameters.
The measured width of this state (86 +
 − 33
 22 ± 12) MeV
is consistent with the width of the Σc (2800)0 measured
by Belle [29]. However, the measured mass of this ex-
cited Σc 0 is (2846 ± 8 ± 10) MeV/c2 , which is 40 MeV/c2
and 3σ higher (assuming Gaussian statistics) than Belle’s
measured mass for the Σc(2800)0.
We evaluate systematic uncertainties for the Σc(2455)0
and the excited Σc 0 yields, masses, and widths by modify-
ing the binning, the resonant signal PDF shape, and the
non-resonant signal PDF shape. Changing the variable
bin sizes leads to the dominant systematic uncertainty in
the masses, widths, and yields of both resonances. For
the Σc (2455)0 , the bin width in the peak region was de-
creased from the nominal 1 MeV/c2 to 0.5 MeV/c2 ; for
the excited Σc 0 , the bin width was varied from 10 to
20 MeV/c2 compared to the nominal 15 MeV/c2 . For both
resonances, an S-wave and a P -wave relativistic Breit-
Wigner (without a resolution function) was used instead
of the nominal resonant signal PDF. The (fixed) non-
resonant threshold parameter for the Σc(2455)0 was var-
ied by ±1σ. A second-order polynomial was used 0 (in-
stead of a first-order polynomial) for the excited Σ c non-
resonant PDF. A summary of the systematic uncertain-
ties for Ysig , mR , and ΓR are summarized in Table VIII.
The significance is recalculated following each of the
variations used to evaluate the systematic uncertain-
ties in the excited Σ 0 c resonance parameters. The re-
sulting significance (including systematics) is 5.2σ. A
cross-check is performed to make sure the Σc (2800)0 sig-
nal is not the result of interference with a ∆(1232)++,
for example (although no significant ∆(1232)++ signal
is seen in the mpπ distribution). The fit is performed
again in the Σc (2800)0 mass region for candidates with
mpπ > 1.5 GeV/c2 . We obtain 1329 ± 230 resonant signal
events (compared to 1449 ± 284 events for the nominal
fit) and a consistent mass and width.
An additional cross-check is performed to investi-
gate whether there are appropriate fractions of resonant
Σc (2800)0 events in different Λ+
 c decay modes. This is
accomplished by dividing the s Plot-weighted, efficiency-
corrected data into two samples according to the Λ+
 c de-
cay mode. Note that this cross-check neglects statistical
correlations from the combined mr vs. mm fit (less than
15%) among the Λ+
 c decay modes. A binned χ2

events ((9 ± 3)%). (In order for this fit to converge, mR
and ΓR were fixed to their nominal values.) The fractions
are consistent in the two samples and the total (1306±239
events) is consistent with the nominal fit result within
uncertainties.
We have also investigated the possibility that there
are two resonances in the mass range shown in Figure 7.
However, there is no evidence for two distinct vertical
bands in this region in the B − → Λ+
 c pπ
−
 Dalitz plot
(Figure 3), and we do not obtain a statistically significant
fit to two resonances.
In order to measure the fraction of B− → Λ +
 c pπ
 −
 de-
cays that proceed through intermediate Σc resonances,
we assume that the contribution from each Λ+

mode for events in the Σc regions is equal to the measured
contribution from each Λ+

and non-resonant) B − −

tematic uncertainties and corresponds to 109 events. The

Therefore approximately 1/4 of B − → Λ+

MEASUREMENT OF THE Σc (2455)0 SPIN
The Σc (2455)0 is the lowest mass Σc state. In the
P 1 +
quark model, it is expected to have J = , where J is
2the spin and P is the parity. In this section, we provide
a quantitative evaluation of the spin-1/2 and spin-3/2
hypotheses for the Σc (2455)0 baryon.
We determine the spin of the Σc (2455)0 through
an angular analysis −
 of the decay B − → Σc(2455)0 p,
Σc(2455)0 → Λ+
 c π . We define a helicity angle θh as the
angle between the momentum vector of the Λ+
 c and the
momentum vector of the recoiling B-daughter p in the
rest frame of the Σc (2455)0. If we assume J(Λ+
 c ) = 1/2,
the angular distributions for the spin-1/2 and spin-3/2
hypotheses for the Σc (2455)0 are
These are the ideal distributions; the measured angular
distributions will be somewhat degraded due to nonuni-
form detector efficiencies, finite experimental resolution
for measuring θh , and background contamination. We
estimate the effects of inefficiencies and background con-
tamination by performing parameterized MC studies to
quantify the decrease in sensitivity to discriminate be-
tween possible spin values.
If we select from a ±2σ signal region in mm and mr ,
without s Plot weights or efficiency corrections, there are
127 events in the Σc (2455)0 signal region and 27 events
in the Σc (2455)0 background regions (2.430 < mΛc π <
2.445 GeV/c2 and 2.463 < mΛc π < 2.478 GeV/c2 ). Scal-
ing the number of events in the background region by
the ratio of the total width of the background regions
compared to the width of the signal region, we expect
7.2 ± 1.3 background events in the signal region.
We measure the finite experimental resolution of cos θh
by comparing the measured value of cos θh to the true
value of cos θh in B− → Λ+
 c pπ −
, Λc +
 → pK − π+
 events in
a signal MC sample. The maximum root mean square of
the measured value of cos θh minus the true value of cos θh
in the Σc(2455)0 signal region determines the helicity
angle resolution σ(cos θh ) < 0.03. Therefore the finite
experimental resolution is small compared to any features
in the spin-1/2 or spin-3/2 angular distributions.
We investigate the discrimination power between spin
hypotheses using parameterized MC studies. In general,
where the log yi likelihood is the probability is computed density as for ln L observing =
 Pi wi event ln(yi i.
 ),
The weight wi for the MC studies is wi = εi , where εi
is the efficiency for event i. We compute a log likelihood
for each hypothesis:

The shape of the cos θh distribution for background
events is estimated from the shape of the helicity distri-
bution for events in the background regions. The helicity
distribution for these events is illustrated in Fig. 8 as a
non-parametric PDF (a histogram). This PDF is used to
generate the number of background events in the signal
region with a Poisson uncertainty (7.2 ± 2.7). The total
number of events in the sample is fixed to 127, so the
background effectively dilutes the signal distribution.
We then generate 500 samples (127 events each) and
compute the likelihood L that each generated distribu-
tion is uniform in cos θh (spin-1/2) or distributed as
1 + 3 cos2 θh (spin-3/2). We define the quantity ∆ ln L =
ln L(1/2) − ln L(3/2). Figure 9 shows the distribution
∆ ln L for events generated with each hypothesis. The
dashed histogram (negative values of ∆ ln L) corresponds
to samples generated according to the spin-3/2 hypoth-
esis, and the solid histogram (positive values of ∆ ln L)
corresponds to samples generated according to the spin-
1/2 hypothesis. For each distribution, the separation
from zero illustrates how well we can discriminate be-
tween hypotheses given 127 signal events.
The helicity angle distribution for events in the signal
region around the Σc (2455)0 is shown in Figure 10. The
points are efficiency-corrected. Functions corresponding
to the spin-1/2 (solid) and spin-3/2 (dashed) hypotheses
are overlaid. We compute the difference in log likelihood
between the hypotheses: ∆ ln L = +19.2. We indicate
the value of ∆ ln L in data with a vertical line in Figure 9.
The observed value of ∆ ln L is consistent with the spin-
1/2 hypothesis and excludes the spin-3/2 hypothesis at
the > 4σ level.
The ideal angular distributions for the Σc(2455)0
stated in Eqn. 19 are also applicable for the excited Σc 0
resonance. Unlike the narrow Σc(2455)0 resonance near
threshold, the excited Σc 0 is much wider and therefore its
angular distribution is extremely contaminated by the
non-resonant signal events underneath the signal. We
perform a non-resonant sideband subtraction to extract
the helicity angle distribution of the excited Σc 0 , but are
limited by the number of signal events available. An
examination of this distribution is somewhat consistent
with a J = 1/2 hypothesis, but no conclusive statement
can be made about the spin of the observed excited Σc 0 .
We have presented branching fraction measurements
for the decays B 0 → Λ+
 c p and B−
 → Λc +
pπ−
 :
where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and
due to the uncertainty in B(Λ+
 c → pK −π +
), respectively.
These measurements are based on 383 million BB events
produced by the SLAC B Factory and recorded by the
B A B AR detector.
If we combine the statistical and systematic uncertain-
ties only, we obtain B(B 0 → Λ+
 c p) = (1.9 ± 0.2) × 10
−5
,
which is consistent with a previous measurement by the
Belle Collaboration of B(B 0 → Λ+
 c p) = (2.2 ± 0.6) ×
10−5 [30]. Both measurements use the same value for
B(Λ+
 c → pK −π+
 ). However, − +
 our −
 measurement for the
 −4
three-body mode, B(B → Λ c pπ ) = (3.4 ± 0.2) × 10 ,
is significantly larger (by about 4σ) than the previous
measurement −4
 from Belle B(B− → Λ+
 c pπ −
 ) = (2.1±0.3)×
10 [25]. The Belle Collaboration measurement uses six
coarse regions across the B − → Λ+
 c pπ
−
 Dalitz plane to
correct for variations in efficiency; we use much finer re-
gions and see significant variation near the edges of the
Dalitz plane. This difference in efficiency treatment may
account for some of the discrepancy between the two re-
sults.
One of the main motivations for studying baryonic
B-meson decays is to gain knowledge about baryon-
antibaryon production in meson decays. We have mea-
sured the ratio of the two branching fractions,
In this quantity the 26% uncertainty in B(Λ+
 c → pK −π+
 )
cancels in the branching ratio.
We have also measured the fractions of B − → Λ+
 c pπ
−
decays that proceed through a Σc resonance:
Assuming no interference with direct decay to Λ+
 c pπ −
 ,
about 1/4 of B−
 → Λc +
pπ−
 decays proceed through a Σc
resonance.
The order of magnitude difference between the decay
rates of B − → Λ+
 c pπ
 −
 and two-body decays such as
 B 0 → Λ+
 c p, B
−
 → Σc(2455)0p, and B− → Σc(2800)0p
is consistent with the theoretical description [16] that
baryonic B decays are favored when the baryon and an-
tibaryon are close together in phase space. This inter-
pretation is also supported by the observation of the
enhancement in rate when m Λc p is near threshold. Al-
though the Λ+
 c p threshold enhancement alone could in-
dicate a resonance below threshold, enhancements have
been observed in other baryon-antibaryon systems and
in decays such as e+e− → ppγ [1, 2]. Therefore the body
of measurements indicates that we are observing a phe-
nomenon that is common to baryon production from me-
son decays, and possibly common to baryon production
in general.
We have used the angular distribution of the decay
B− → Σc (2455)0p to study the spin of the Σc 0 baryon.
The helicity angle distribution is consistent with being
uniform, which indicates that the Σc 0 has J = 1/2 as-
suming the ground state Λ+
 c also has J = 1/2 and ex-
cludes the J = 3/2 hypothesis at the > 4σ level. This is
consistent with quark model expectations for the lowest
Σc baryon state.
We also observe an excited Σc state in B-meson de-
cays to Λ+
 c pπ −
 .
 We measure the mass of this reso-
nance to +
 33
 be (2846 ± 8 ± 10) MeV/c2 and the width to
be (86 − 22) MeV. It is possible that this observation
is a confirmation of a triplet of Σc (2800) states seen in
Λ+
 c π
 −
 continuum production [29]. However, the neutral
Σc (2800)0 has a measured mass of (2802 +
 − 4
 7) MeV/c2

the state observed in B decays are consistent, but the
masses are 3σ apart. If these are indeed the same state,
then the discrepancy in measured masses needs to be re-
solved.
Another possible interpretation is that the excited Σc 0
resonance seen in this analysis is not the Σc (2800)0 that
was previously observed. A clear signal is evident for
B − → Σc (2455)0 p decays, − but we do not see any evi-
dence for the − decay B → Σc(2520)0p. The absence of
the decay B → Σc (2520)0 p is in contrast to a claimed
2.9σ signal from an analysis by the Belle Collaboration
based on 152 million BB events [25]. Also, an examina-

→a well-established state, and so is the ∆(1232)++. Both
are expected to have J = 3/2. The Belle Collaboration
tentatively identified the Σc (2800) 0 as J = 3/2 based on
the measured mass of the state, while there is weak ev-
idence that the excited Σc 0 we observe is J = 1/2. It is
therefore possible that B decays to higher-spin baryons
are suppressed, perhaps due to the same baryon produc-
tion mechanisms that suppress two-body baryonic de-
cays, and that the excited Σc 0 state that we have observed
is a newly-observed spin-1/2 state.
