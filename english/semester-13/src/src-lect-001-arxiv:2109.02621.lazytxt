               1 Introduction
               Few studies of beauty-baryon decays to ﬁnal states involving a single open-charm meson
               exist, but they are nonetheless promising for measurements of CP violation [1–3]. A
               measurement of a set of branching fraction ratios of Λ0 and Ξ decays to ﬁnal states
                                                                         b       b

               referred to as the favoured (suppressed) decay throughout this paper. The suppressed
               decay is of particular interest since its decay amplitude receives contributions from b → c
               and b → u amplitudes of similar magnitude, given the CKM suppression between the
               two D decays. The interference between these two amplitudes, which depends upon the
               CKMangle γ, is expected to be large [7,8], but the diﬀerent strong phases associated
               with the various conﬁgurations of polarisation states for the Λ0, proton, and intermediate

               Sensitivity to CP-violation requires interference between amplitudes involving intermediate
               D0 and D0 mesons. This interference is anticipated to be ampliﬁed in regions of the phase
               space involving Λ0 → DX contributions, where X labels excited Λ states. Therefore, the
                                 b
               ratio of branching fractions and the CP asymmetry in the suppressed mode are measured
               separately in the full phase space and in a restricted phase-space region which involves
               Λ0 →DX decays, where an enhanced sensitivity to γ is expected.

          2 Detector and simulation
          TheLHCbdetector[9,10]isasingle-armforwardspectrometer covering the pseudorapidity
          range 2 < η < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The
          detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex
          detector surrounding the pp interaction region [11], a large-area silicon-strip detector
          located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4Tm, and three
          stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [12,13] placed downstream of the
          magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged
          particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at
          200GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary pp collision vertex (PV), the
          impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/pT)µm, where pT is
          the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Diﬀerent types of
          charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov
          detectors [14]. Hadrons are identiﬁed by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-
          pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter. The online
          event selection is performed by a trigger [15], which consists of a hardware stage, based
          on information from the calorimeter, followed by a software stage, which applies a full
          event reconstruction.
            Simulation is required to model the eﬀects of the detector acceptance and the imposed
          selection requirements. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia [16]
          with a speciﬁc LHCb conﬁguration [17]. Decays of unstable particles are described
          by EvtGen [18], in which ﬁnal-state radiation is generated using Photos [19]. The
          interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented
          using the Geant4 toolkit [20] as described in Ref. [21].
            The particle identiﬁcation (PID) response in the simulated samples is corrected using
          control samples of Λ+ → pK−π+ decays in LHCb data, taking into account its correlation
                      c
          with the kinematic properties of each track and with the event multiplicity. To parametrise
          the PIDresponse, an unbinned method is employed, where the probability density functions
         (PDFs) are modelled using kernel density estimation [22].
          3 Reconstruction and selection of candidates
          Neutral D meson candidates are reconstructed by combining kaon and pion candidates
          having opposite charge. To form Λ0 candidates, the neutral D meson candidates are
                                 b
          combined with proton and kaon candidates having opposite charge. Each Λ0 candidate is
                                                          b
          associated to the PV for which the value of χ2 is minimised, where χ2 is the diﬀerence
                                       IP              IP

          between the vertex χ of a given PV with and without the Λb candidate included in the
          PVﬁt. The tracks forming the Λ0 candidate are required to have good ﬁt quality and to
                               b
          be well separated from any PV in the event. The invariant masses of the Λ0 candidate,
                                                           b
          M(DpK−), and of the D candidate, M(Kπ), are required to be in the intervals from
                      2                2
          5200 to 7000MeV/c and 1850 to 1880MeV/c , respectively. Candidates with M(Kπ) in
                                       2
          a wider mass range from 1765 to 1965MeV/c are retained to quantify the background
          contribution from charmless b-hadron decays. A kinematic ﬁt is performed in which
          M(Kπ) is constrained to the known D0 mass [6] and the Λ0 candidate’s trajectory is
                                                 b
          required to point back to the associated PV [23]. To improve the resolution of the squared
                                      2
               invariant masses M2(Dp), M2(DK−) and M2(pK−), the ﬁt is repeated when calculating
               these variables, with the additional constraint that the invariant mass of the DpK−
               combination is equal to the known Λ0 mass [6]. Inclusion of the mass constraint improves
                                                    b
               the resolution on the two-body masses by 50% or more, depending upon position in the
               three-body phase space.

               or pion, are vetoed by requiring that the invariant mass of any ph h  combination diﬀers
               from the known Λ+ mass [6] by more than 20MeV/c2. To suppress the contribution of
                                  c

               events from charmless Λb → ph h h decays, the decay-time signiﬁcance of the D meson
               candidates with respect to the Λ0 vertex is required to be larger than 2.5. The decay-time
                                               b
               signiﬁcance of the D candidate is deﬁned as the measured decay time divided by its
               uncertainty.
                  Tosuppress combinatorial background, a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm using
               adaptive boosting [24] is employed as implemented in the TMVA toolkit [25]. To train
               the BDT classiﬁer, one for the full and another for the restricted phase space, a sample of
               simulated Λ0 → [K−π+]DpK− decays is used as a proxy for signal and candidates in the
                           b
               Λ0 mass sidebands with mass in the intervals from 5300 to 5400MeV/c2 and from 5900 to
                b
               6000MeV/c2 are used to represent combinatorial background. The variables that enter the
               BDTselection are the quality of the kinematic ﬁt, the quality of the Λ0 and D vertices
                                                                                        b
               and their decay-time signiﬁcances, PID variables, and the pT of the ﬁnal-state particles.
               The optimisation criterion used to determine the choice of BDT working point is the
                                                                                          p
               maximum expected statistical signiﬁcance of the suppressed signal, Nsig/      Nsig + Nbkg,
               where N    and N     are the expected numbers of signal and background candidates in
                       sig       bkg

               the mass interval from 5600 to 5640MeV/c . The expected number of suppressed signal
               decays is determined by dividing the observed yield in the favoured decay by the Cabibbo
               suppression factor deﬁned in Eq. 1 using values for the CKM matrix elements taken
               from [26]. In 0.1% of events multiple Λ0 candidates are reconstructed. All the candidates
                                                      b
               are retained.
               4 Determination of signal yields
               The mass distributions for the DpK− candidates in the favoured and suppressed data
               samples in the full phase space are shown in Fig. 1. The number of signal candidates
               is obtained by an extended unbinned maximum-likelihood ﬁt to the M(DpK−) mass
               distributions using the RooFit package [27]. The favoured and suppressed samples are
               ﬁtted simultaneously. The PDF used for the favoured sample is made of two components
               to model Λ0 → DpK− and Ξ0 → DpK− signals, a background from misidentiﬁed
                           b                   b
               Λ0 →Dpπ− decays, and a partially reconstructed background from Λ0 → D∗pK− decays
                b                                                                    b
               whereD∗0 →D0γ orD∗0 →D0π0andtheγ orπ0 particleisnotreconstructed. Additional
               components are required to describe the background due to partially reconstructed
               Λ0 → D∗pπ− decays, with D∗0 → D0γ or D∗0 → D0π0 and having the pion from the
                b

                b                                                           b
               peak in the signal region, and from combinatorial background. The PDF used to ﬁt the
               suppressed sample is the same, except that it does not include contributions from the
               Ξ0 →D(∗)pK− and Λ0 → D(∗)pπ− decays, which are expected to be negligible.

                  The parametrised shape of each component is taken from a ﬁt to simulated decays

                  after all selections are applied. The signal and partially reconstructed background are
                  each modelled by the sum of two Crystal Ball (CB) functions [28], where the parameters
                  governing the shape of the tails are ﬁxed to their values in ﬁts to simulated samples.
                 The background from misidentiﬁed Λ0 → Dpπ− decays is parametrised by the sum of a
                                                               b

                  Gaussian and a CB function. In the restricted phase-space region, M (pK ) < 5GeV /c ,
                  the same functional forms are used, except that the partially reconstructed background is
                  parametrised by the sum of a bifurcated Gaussian and a CB function. The combinatorial
                  background is described by an exponential function. The slope of the combinatorial
                  background is allowed to vary independently in the favoured and suppressed samples.
                 The widths of each peaking component are multiplied by a common free parameter in
                  order to account for the diﬀerence between the invariant-mass resolution observed in data
                  and simulation. The mass of the Λ0 baryon is a free parameter, while the mass diﬀerence

                      The resonant structure of the favoured and suppressed decays can be illuminated

                  signal purity for the favoured decay is comparable to that for the suppressed decay due
                  to the presence of the background from Ξ0 → D∗pK− and Λ0 → Dpπ− decays in the

                  to states having udc and uds quark content, respectively. The M(Dp) distribution
                  shows an increased density of events in the low-M(Dp) region with a contribution from
                  Λc(2860)+ → D0p decays. The distribution of M(pK−) contains a contribution from
                  the Λ(1520) baryon at low-M(pK−) and an enhancement at 2.5 . M(pK−) . 3.5GeV/c2,

            The data samples in the full and restricted phase-space region partially overlap and the
            statistical uncertainties on the ratios and asymmetries measured in these two regions
            are correlated. A positive correlation between the statistical uncertainties of ρ = 0.33 is
            estimated, given the number of events in the two samples and their overlap.
            6 Systematic uncertainties
            The systematic uncertainties on the ratio of branching fractions of the favoured and
            suppressed decays and the CP asymmetry of the suppressed decay are listed in Table 2.
            For each variation, the determination of R and A is performed, and the diﬀerence with
            respect to the nominal result is taken as systematic uncertainty. Where multiple variations
            are considered, the largest negative and positive deviations are taken. For the measurement
            of R and A, many systematic eﬀects cancel in the ratios. The total systematic uncertainties
            are obtained by summing all the contributions in quadrature.
              To assess systematic uncertainties due to the description of signal and background
            contributions in the invariant mass ﬁt model, alternative parameterisations for the Λ0
                                                                                  b
            mass peak, partially reconstructed background components and combinatorial background
            are used. The corresponding systematic uncertainties amount to (1–5)%. The eﬃciency
            corrections are impacted by the limited size of the signal simulation sample. This is
            assessed by varying the parameters of the kernel density estimation. The corresponding
            systematic uncertainties are (1–3)%.
              The PID response in data is obtained from calibration samples [30,31]. The associated
            systematic uncertainty includes the kernel width variation and the uncertainty due to
            ﬁnite sample size of the calibration samples. The resulting uncertainty is 2% for R, and
            less than 1% for A.
              The hardware-level trigger decision is not perfectly simulated. The impact of this
            mismodelling is estimated by varying the eﬃciency map according to a correction obtained
            from data control samples. The resulting systematic uncertainty is at the level of 0.5%.
              The background from charmless decays is estimated by interpolating from the D
            mass sidebands into the D mass region after all selection requirements are imposed and
            found to be 0.5% and 1% in the favoured and suppressed samples, respectively. These
            values are taken as uncertainties and propagated to the measurement of R, resulting in an
            uncertainty of 1% on R, while the corresponding uncertainty on A is assumed to cancel.
              Doubly misidentiﬁed background, where the kaon and pion in the favoured mode are
            swapped, leads to a background that peaks at the Λ0 mass in the suppressed sample. This
                                                    b
            contribution is estimated from simulation to be 0.5% in the suppressed sample, and this
            value is assigned as an uncertainty in R. Furthermore, the impact of Λ0 → DpK− decays
                                                                    b

              with subsequent D → K−K+ or D → π−π+ decays, when one of the D decay products is
              misidentiﬁed, is found to be 0.1%.
                  The asymmetry in Λ0 and Λ0 production is expected to inﬂuence the measurement
                                      b       b
              of A. The average values were measured to be (1.92 ± 0.35)% and (1.09 ± 0.29)% at
              7 and 8TeV centre-of-mass energies, respectively [32]. The production asymmetry is
              expected to decrease still further for a centre-of-mass energy of 13TeV [33,34]. A 1.5%
              systematic uncertainty is assigned. Furthermore, the detection asymmetry of the Λ0 decay
                                                                                             b
              products is also expected to inﬂuence the measurement of A. The asymmetry in detecting
              protons versus antiprotons has been studied in detail [32] and does not exceed 1.5% for
              various values of proton momentum. The asymmetry of π+ and π− detection was studied
              in Ref. [35] and found to be less than 0.5%. These values are assigned as systematic
              uncertainties. Any inﬂuence of K+ and K− detection asymmetry is expected to cancel
              for the K+ meson from the D meson and the K− meson from the Λ0 baryon.
                                                                                 b
                  Pseudoexperiments were used to verify that the ﬁt used to determine the Λ0 signal
                                                                                             b
              yields was unbiased, and no uncertainty from this source is included.

                      Within the uncertainties, the ratio of the favoured and suppressed branching fractions
                  is consistent with the estimate based on the relevant CKM matrix elements. The measured
                  asymmetry values are consistent with zero, both in the full phase space and in the region
                 where enhanced sensitivity to the CKM angle γ is expected. While the present signal
                 yields are too low to be used to extract γ, larger samples are expected to be collected
                  by LHCb in the coming years, and the study of this mode will contribute to the overall
                  determination of γ.
