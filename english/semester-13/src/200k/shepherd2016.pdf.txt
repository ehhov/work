Searching for the rules that govern
hadron construction
Matthew R. Shepherd1, Jozef J. Dudek2,3 & Ryan E. Mitchell1
Just as quantum electrodynamics describes how electrons are bound in atoms by the electromagnetic force, mediated by
the exchange of photons, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes how quarks are bound inside hadrons by the strong
force, mediated by the exchange of gluons. QCD seems to allow hadrons constructed from increasingly many quarks to
exist, just as atoms with increasing numbers of electrons exist, yet such complex constructions seemed, until recently,
not to be present in nature. Here we describe advances in the spectroscopy of mesons that are refining our understanding
of the rules for predicting hadron structure from QCD.
W
hile decades of experimental study support QCD as the
underlying theory of quark interactions, a detailed under-
standing of the way QCD generates protons, neutrons, and
other strongly interacting ‘hadrons’ remains elusive. The majority of
observed hadrons fall neatly into only two very limited sets: baryons,
which are consistent with being three-quark constructions (qqq); and
mesons, which are quark–antiquark (qq ) constructions. QCD also appears
to allow constructions featuring larger numbers of quarks as well as had-
rons built not only from quarks, but also from gluons. This has raised the
question of why, until possibly now, there has been no evidence for a
spectrum of such hadrons. Have we just been historically unsuccessful in
producing these exotic particles in the laboratory, or are there more
restrictive rules for building hadrons that are not obvious from the
unsolved equations of QCD? Here we choose to focus specifically on the
spectrum of mesons, where timely developments in both theory and
experiment can be used to illustrate how the field of hadron spectroscopy
addresses fundamental questions about QCD, questions that are common
to both the meson and baryon sectors.
Interacting quarks and gluons in QCD
Within QCD, the ‘charge’ that controls the interactions of quarks is known
as ‘colour’, and it was the study of the empirical spectrum of hadrons that
first introduced the concept of quarks and their threefold colour charge.
Interactions in QCD are symmetric under changes of colour, that is, no
single colour of quark behaves differently from the other two, and impos-
ing this symmetry on the theory uniquely defines the interactions allowed
in QCD between the quarks and the force-carrying gluons. Coloured
quarks can interact by emitting or absorbing gluons, and because they
carry colour charge themselves, gluons can also emit and absorb gluons.
Although observations about the spectrum of hadrons inspired the
fundamental theory of quark interactions, calculating the detailed spec-
trum from this theory has so far been impossible. The difficulties in
these calculations stem from the presence of gluon–gluon interactions,
which make QCD forces very strong on the distance scale of 10−15 m
that characterizes hadrons. This ultimately results in a property called
‘confinement’, whereby quarks are permanently trapped inside composite
hadrons, making it difficult to isolate the interaction of a single quark
and antiquark from the collective behaviour of quarks and gluons in the
hadron. The strong coupling means that, unlike for the electromagnetic
force, where the exchange of two photons between electrons in an atom is
far less probable than the exchange of just one, exchange of any number of
gluons between quarks in a hadron is every bit as probable as exchanging
one. Because of this, there is no simple method of calculating the net
effect of interactions between two quarks, and a QCD calculation of the
mass of a hadron, easily measurable by experiment, becomes intractable.
Understanding QCD via rules for building hadrons
Our inability to solve the equations of QCD is not just a curiosity—it
restricts our understanding of the behaviour and structure of hadrons,
owing to the lack of any simple relationship between the fundamental
quarks and gluons of QCD and the spectrum of hadrons observed
experimentally. This has motivated the use of heuristic models, or
‘rules’, that serve as a bridge between QCD and experiment, capturing
the important features of the spectrum while attempting to respect the
known properties of QCD. The development of a rulebook for con-
struction of hadrons consistent with both QCD and experimental data
would arguably define what it means to understand how QCD generates
hadrons. A uniform set of rules may not exist—there may be no simple
way to capture the complex behaviour of QCD—but the high degree of
regularity in the experimental spectrum of hadrons suggests that this is
not a forlorn hope, and the search for this rulebook drives the field of
hadron spectroscopy.
An important area of exploration attempts to create previously unob-
served classes of hadrons in the laboratory, such as quark–gluon hybrids
or tetraquarks. From the pattern of such states, or their absence, we can
refine our understanding of the rules of hadron construction. A second
area develops techniques for calculating the observable properties of
hadrons directly from QCD, which will indicate how the rules follow from
the strong interactions of quarks and gluons prescribed by that theory.
In what follows we will review the current developments in each of these
two areas and discuss the prospects for achieving the goal of determining
the rulebook for hadron construction.
Rules inferred from experimental data
We label hadrons by their mass and their quantum numbers J (spin),
P (parity, behaviour under reflection in a mirror), and C (charge-
conjugation, behaviour under exchange of particles with antiparticles).
These properties are directly observable, but other characteristics, such as
their internal composition, must be inferred. As the number of observed
hadrons has increased over the last half-century, definite patterns have
emerged that have led to an initial set of simple rules for the construction
of hadrons from quarks.

Figure 1 | The charmonium spectrum. A qq potential model calculation (coloured)60 of the charmonium spectrum is compared to experiment (black)61.
Columns indicate states of common JPC. Potential model states appear in groups labelled by their radial and orbital angular momentum quantum
numbers, nL (coloured text; n =​ 1, 2, 3... L =​ S, P, D, F...).
The quark–antiquark rule for constructing mesons
One of the earliest patterns discovered (in the 1960s) was that mesons
with the same JPC quantum numbers could be grouped into sets of nine
(‘nonet’) having similar mass. This could be explained by combining a
quark q with an antiquark q if there were three ‘flavours’ of quark—these
were given the names ‘up’, ‘down’ and ‘strange’. The lightest nonet of
mesons has JPC =​  0−+, and there are heavier nonets with other JPC values.
It was suggested that the additional mass-energy of the excited hadrons
arises principally from the orbital or radial motion of the quark–antiquark
(qq) pair, in analogy to the excitations of a single-electron atom.
With the discovery of charmonium (in the 1970s)1,2, this quantum-
mechanical picture became more precise—these new mesons with
masses much larger than those observed earlier were explained as being
bound states featuring a new, heavier quark, which was dubbed ‘charm’.
Charmonium mesons with a range of JPC values were observed and their
spectrum (Fig. 1) resembles that of a pair of particles bound by a potential.
The large mass of the charm quark justified such an approach, as many
of the complexities of a relativistic system could be neglected. The poten-
tial needed to describe the spectrum was novel, featuring a steady rise at
large distances that would confine the quarks within the meson3. A fea-
ture of this model of mesons is that it is not possible for a qq pair in any
orbitally or radially excited state to have JPC in the set 0+−, 1−+, 2+−, ….
Sets of mesons with these ‘exotic’ quantum numbers were not convinc-
ingly observed experimentally, either in charmonium or for the lighter
quarks, supporting the qq picture.
Until recently virtually all experimentally observed hadrons could have their
presence explained by a simple rule stating that each meson is constructed
from a qq pair, and each baryon from a three-quark configuration. However,
it has never been at all obvious why QCD is so parsimonious—why are there
not meson-like states of two quarks and two antiquarks (‘tetraquarks’), or
baryon-like states of four quarks and an antiquark (‘pentaquarks’)?
Furthermore, since the gluons of QCD strongly interact just as quarks do,
could we not have ‘hybrid mesons’ in which gluons bind to a qq pair, and
‘glueballs’ that do not require quarks at all? Observation of hadrons like these
would challenge the simple rule outlined above, and indeed, recent experi-
mental results are casting doubt on how parsimonious QCD really is.

Recent results challenge the qq
A powerful way to study the meson spectrum is to collide high-energy
beams of electrons and positrons and to observe the rate at which systems
of hadrons are produced. In this process, the e+e− pair first annihilates,
producing a photon; the photon converts into a quark and antiquark,
which then interact, exchanging gluons and perhaps creating more qq
pairs; finally, these quarks and gluons arrange themselves into a system
of hadrons that are observed by the particle detector. If the collision
energy is close to the mass of a meson with JPC =​  1−− quantum numbers,
the system ‘resonates’, and the probability of a collision increases. Thus, a
plot of the normalized rate of hadron production, the ‘cross-section’,
against the e+e− centre-of-mass energy, shows peaks corresponding to
the produced meson states, also known as ‘resonances’ (Fig. 2a). These
excited states exist only briefly before decaying into the set of observed
lighter hadrons, and the width of the peak is inversely related to the
lifetime of the state.
Figure 2a depicts the total rate of hadron production as a function of
the e+e− centre-of-mass energy. The peaks are interpreted as evidence for
a series of excited states—the ψ(3770), ψ(4040), ψ(4160) and ψ(4415)—
consistent with expectations from the qq picture (see Fig. 1). But recent
experimental advances have allowed a closer inspection. If instead of the
total rate, we look at the rates for the production of specific systems of
hadrons, distinct features appear that have no simple explanation in the
qq picture.
The production rate of the π​+π​−J/ψ system, shown in Fig. 2b, provides
one such example. (The J/ψ is a hadron that, for historical reasons, has
two names associated with it, J and ψ.) Here, a prominent peak appears
at 4,260 MeV, which, surprisingly, lies between the masses of the ψ(4160)
and ψ(4415) states. Unlike the ψ(4160) and ψ(4415), this Y(4260) reso-
nance has no explanation within the qq picture. Another example is the
production rate of the π​+π​−ψ′​system. The Y(4260) resonance might be
expected also to appear here, since π​+π​−J/ψ and π​+π​−ψ′​are very similar
systems, but it does not. Instead, two peaks appear, for Y(4360) and
Y(4660) (Fig. 2c), in further disagreement with the spectrum suggested
by the total cross-section. These Y states, which appear in addition
to those expected within the qq picture, may be a signal that QCD
does indeed produce mesons with internal structures beyond the
simple qq rule.
The observation of new states in charmonium, which was previously
believed to be well understood, has spurred searches for further exotic
candidate states, observations of which are providing still more challenges
for the simple qq rule. For example, a detailed study of the π​+π​−J/ψ
system produced in Y(4260) decays showed that the π​±J/ψ system (Fig. 3a)

appears to resonate at a mass of 3,900 MeV, producing an electrically
charged state labelled Z(3900)4–6. This structure is particularly noteworthy
because its large mass and decay featuring J/ψ suggest that it contains a
charm quark and an anti-charm quark, while its net electric charge
requires further light (up- and down-flavoured) quarks. It is thus a
possible tetraquark. A pattern of such states is beginning to emerge
around 4 GeV: for example, in the π​​+π​​−hc system, also produced in e+e−
collisions, another electrically charged structure, Z(4020), appears in the
π​​±hc spectrum7 (Fig. 3b) with a somewhat larger mass.
These new states can also, in principle, be produced in the weak decay of
heavy mesons containing a bottom quark. Strangely, recent experimental
data yields no evidence of Z(3900) production in such decays8. Instead,
signals for still further new states of higher mass are observed8–11.
A related process is the decay of heavy baryons containing a bottom
quark, and here, equally as surprising, we find what appears to be a
resonating proton–J/ψ system12. This hadron is a possible pentaquark.
Although the origin of these new states is not yet firmly established, they
present a serious challenge to the simple rules for constructing mesons
and baryons that we previously believed were obeyed by QCD.
The pattern of conventional mesons nicely replicates itself for each fla-
vour of quark: many structures that appear in the spectrum of light quarks
(up, down, strange) reappear for charm quarks at the 3-GeV scale, and
again for bottom quarks at the 10-GeV scale. One might also expect that
any spectrum of hybrids, tetraquarks or other novel constructions should
have recurrent patterns for different quark flavours. In fact, bottom-quark
analogues of the charged tetraquark candidates in charmonium have been
reported13. Historically, these observations preceded those in charmonium.
Like tetraquarks and pentaquarks, another class of hadrons that appear
to be allowed by the fundamental interactions of QCD are quark–gluon

hybrids, in which gluons and quarks have a role in setting the quantum
numbers of the hadron. A subset of possible hybrid mesons have a unique
experimental signature: exotic JPC not accessible to a qq pair. While there
are experimental indications of exotic hybrid candidates14–18, no firmly
established spectrum of hybrid mesons has been discovered.
In parallel to the experimental work discussed above, theoretical efforts
are underway to understand whether QCD predicts the existence of
hadrons which go beyond the qq meson and three-quark baryon rule, or
whether the collective behaviour of quarks and gluons excludes the con-
struction of more exotic combinations. It is to such calculations that our
attention now turns.
Rules derived from QCD
Much of our understanding of hadrons is informed by models, which may
be motivated by features of QCD, by empirical observations, or both. A
goal is to develop an understanding that is based on rigorous calculations
of the interaction of quarks and gluons through the equations of QCD.
However, the strongly coupled nature of QCD makes techniques that are
practical for calculating weak and electromagnetic interactions ineffective
for predicting properties of hadrons that emerge from QCD. We need a
different approach, one that utilizes the fact that all fundamental parti-
cles, including quarks and gluons in QCD, are more correctly thought
of as fluctuating quantum fields. The quantum aspect of the theory is
embodied in the fact that observable consequences follow from a sum
over all possible configurations in space and time that these fields can

take. The method known as lattice QCD makes the approximation of
considering these fields on a discrete grid of points describing a restricted
region of space-time. A finite, but large, number of possible configura-
tions of the fields on this grid can be generated using random sampling on
a computer, and a good approximation for observable hadron properties
obtained. The volume of the grid and number of field configurations
required to achieve useful precision demands substantial computational
resources. Total computational times of several teraflop-years are not
unusual for contemporary calculations, with such efforts making use
of ‘leadership-class’ supercomputing facilities—future precision lattice
QCD calculations of increased sophistication will require petaflop-scale
machines.
Lattice QCD has been applied with substantial success to a broad range
of processes involving hadrons19, including the spectrum and internal
structure of the lightest hadrons20, the behaviour of hadrons at non-zero
temperature, relevant in collisions of heavy ions21, and heavy flavour
decays, in which a heavy quark confined inside a meson decays through
the weak interaction22.
Lattice QCD as a tool for hadron spectroscopy
Our interest is in the determination of properties of excited hadrons,
where obtaining a high degree of numerical precision is an issue that is
secondary to the more basic question of whether certain states exist or do
not. In the past few years we have seen excellent progress in overcoming
the challenges posed by these calculations. Exploration of the excited
hadron spectrum is possible using an approach in which each state in the
spectrum is produced by a different combination of quark and gluon field
constructions, and for this method to be successful, a large set of possible
constructions is required. The dynamics of QCD, implemented by the
sum over possible field configurations, determines which combination
of constructions is present in each state in the spectrum. A scheme out-
lined in refs 23 and 24 includes many constructions resembling qq pairs
with various orbital motions and radial wavefunctions, motivated by the
success of the qq rule in describing the experimental hadron spectrum.
More elaborate structures are possible, though, and refs 23 and 24
included several that feature the gluon field in a non-trivial way, inspired
by the possibility that hybrid mesons may be allowed by QCD.
This large set of constructions, coupled with advances in computa-
tional techniques25, and the application of state-of-the-art computing
hardware26,27, led to the pioneering results presented in Fig. 4 for the
spectrum of mesons constructed from light up and down quarks. The
computational challenges of these calculations currently require the
utilization of masses for the lightest quarks that are heavier than the phys-
ical up and down quark masses, which leads to a systematic shift in the
computed meson masses. However, since the immediate goal is to under-
stand the underlying QCD dynamics by studying the pattern of states,
rather than precisely to predict the mass of each meson, the computed
spectrum allows us to develop intuitive rules for constructing hadrons
that generally apply for quarks of any mass.

The spectrum presented in Fig. 4 qualitatively reproduces many of the
features of the experimental light meson spectrum, and further it reflects
the simple picture of qq mesons, with the bulk of the states fitting into the
pattern expected for states excited with increasing amounts of orbital
angular momentum and/or excitations in the radial quantum number.
There are some notable exceptions to this pattern, however, in particular
the 0−+, 1−− and 2−+ states between 2.1 GeV and 2.4 GeV do not have an
obvious explanation, and most strikingly there is a clear spectrum of states
with exotic JPC =​  1−+, 0+− and 2+−, which cannot be constructed from a
qq pair alone.
These additional mesons, which go beyond the set predicted by the qq
rule, have a natural explanation as quark–gluon hybrid mesons.
Previously, estimates for the spectrum of hybrid mesons came only from
models, which made educated guesses for the behaviour of the strongly
coupled gluons inside a hadron. Different guesses led to very different
predictions for the number and mass of hybrid states28–34. Using the lattice
QCD technique, we are now able to predict a definitive pattern of states
directly from the fundamental interactions as prescribed by QCD. Further
calculations35–37, performed with larger values of the quark mass, up as
high as the charm quark mass, show the same pattern of hybrid mesons,
and they are found to be consistently 1.3 GeV heavier than the lightest
JPC =​  1−− meson. The particular pattern of states and the simple mass gap
leads to a new rule of hadron construction for hybrid mesons, namely:
combine qq constructions with a gluonic field that has JPC =​  1+− and a
mass of about 1.3 GeV to form the spectrum of hybrid mesons in QCD.
This is the first example of a rule following from a QCD calculation rather
than being inferred from experimental observations38.
Of course this rule must be verified by producing and studying hybrid
mesons in the laboratory, and many current and near-future experiments
include searches for these states in their programmes. Some hybrid meson
candidates have already been observed experimentally in both the light
meson sector14–18 and in the charm region. For example, the Y(4260)
discussed in the previous section has JPC =​  1−−, approximately the right
mass relative to the J/ψ, and it seems to appear in addition to the expected
qq excitations. The new rule of hybrid meson construction would have
this meson partnered with states of JPC =​  (0, 1, 2)−+ at a similar mass.
Searches for these states are underway.
Calculating how hadrons decay
These calculations of the excited meson spectrum within QCD represent
a major step forward in our understanding of hadron spectroscopy, but
they still make approximations that fail to capture an important feature
of excited hadrons—that they are resonances, decaying rapidly to lighter
hadrons. As can be seen in Figs 2 and 3, in simple cases, excited states
appear as characteristic peaks in the rate of observation of certain final-
state mesons, and lattice QCD calculations should be capable of repro-
ducing this behaviour.
Experimentally, resonances are often observed to decay preferentially
into certain sets of mesons and not others, and these patterns can be used

quark–gluon hybrid structure will require observing a spectrum of addi-
tional mesons that cannot be explained by the qq rule. In particular, we
will need to observe a set of states with unusual flavour and/or JPC values.
Cross-section
SS→U→SS
Finding a pattern of hadrons is essential
to infer details of the resonant state’s internal structure. To be able to
calculate the decay properties of the excited hadrons directly from QCD
would provide a powerful tool for interpreting experimental data. In the
case of predictions of previously unobserved excitations, it may also pro-
vide suggested decay channels to be examined in experimental searches.
Extending the calculations described above to account correctly for the
decay of excited states is possible39–46 but challenging, and serious efforts
have only recently begun47–54. As an example of what can be achieved,
in Fig. 5 we present the cross-section for two pions forming the lightest
1−− resonance, known as the ρ, and then decaying back into two pions.
A clear peak is observed, whose position and width provide the mass and
decay rate of the ρ.
These rapidly maturing theoretical techniques will be required to
study the new charmonium mesons, discussed earlier, within QCD.
The observed enhancements are seen only in specific final states, which
implies that the ability to predict how hadrons decay directly from QCD
will be an essential component in interpreting experimental data in the
quest to develop the rules for constructing hadrons.Contemporary technology has enabled experimental investigations at
an unprecedented level of statistical precision, which provides the capa-
bility to discover more rare and interesting phenomena. However, we
must exercise great care when we attempt to interpret experimental
data. For example, one needs to be certain that the same logic that allows
one to deduce the presence of conventional charmonium mesons in
the total hadronic cross-section also applies when one is examining the
cross-section for a single exclusive process that is two orders of magnitude
smaller (see, for example, Fig. 2). Such precise experimental data make
one susceptible to effects that can mimic the experimental signature of
a new hadron, but which in fact may have a more prosaic origin55–59.
This underscores the importance of experimentally establishing a pat-
tern of hadrons: the interpretation of any single state as a new and exotic
construction will certainly be questioned. However, the experimental
observation of an ordered spectrum of states is harder to dismiss as a
misinterpreted experimental artefact.
Likewise, theoretical efforts in lattice QCD must continue in their
attempts to compute the complete set of possible hadrons allowed by
QCD, and to identify patterns of states within that spectrum. Recent
advances have enabled us to develop a simple rule, stated in subsection
‘Lattice QCD as a tool for hadron spectroscopy’, that describes how QCD
constructs hybrid mesons and baryons, in an extension of what we had
already for conventional mesons and baryons—this new rule must be
verified by observing an experimental spectrum of hybrids. Lattice QCD
can also be used to calculate decay properties of hadrons, and identifying
particular characteristic decays of hybrid mesons will guide experimental
searches and aid in interpretations of data. As has been done with hybrids,
lattice QCD needs to determine whether QCD predicts a spectrum of
tetraquark and pentaquark states. A particular priority is in the heavy
quark sectors, where, as we have discussed above, there is recent experi-
mental evidence for such objects. The ability within lattice QCD to vary
arbitrarily the mass of the quarks allows us to identify how the rules of
hadron construction vary, and to identify possible common behaviours
between the heavy charmonium system and the lighter mesons.

The ρ resonance is clearly observed as a peak, and from its position and

The errors represent the uncertainty in the calculation.
Much of what we know about what emerges from strongly coupled QCD
has come from studying patterns of hadrons organized by mass and
quantum numbers like J, P and C. These patterns suggest quarks of
several flavours which may be combined with a single antiquark to form
mesons—a rather simple rule of hadron construction. The theory of
QCD is not limited to such simple constructions, however, and making
a definitive statement about the existence of mesons with four-quark or
Establishing a spectrum of hadrons beyond those described by the simple
qq and qqq rules will require the combined efforts of multiple present and
future experiments. There is a spectroscopy programme within nearly
every particle physics collaboration worldwide. We list the details of a

Most of the recently observed new hadrons have so far been observed
in only a single production or decay process. Observation of the same
state in multiple production and decay modes almost certainly rules out
a misinterpretation of experimental data due to some process-dependent
phenomenon and solidifies the evidence for a new hadron. Therefore the
best current routes to explore new states in the charm sector are by com-
paring results from e+e− collisions (BESIII, Belle, Belle II) and production
in B-meson decay (LHCb, Belle, Belle II). Supplementing these with
results from novel production mechanisms, such as proton–antiproton
annihilation (PANDA), would be extremely valuable.
Experiments aimed at exploring different energy regimes and quark
flavours are essential for a complete understanding of the meson
spectrum, as we expect the underlying patterns of states to be independent
of quark mass. A variety of present and future experiments will allow
access to both the charmonium system (BESIII, Belle, Belle II, LHCb), and
the analogous system of bottom quarks, bottomonium (Belle, Belle II).
Mesons constructed from light quarks can be produced in decays of
heavier mesons and therefore can be studied at all of the previously men-
tioned facilities; they can also be produced at experiments dedicated to
the study of lighter systems (COMPASS, GlueX). Discovery of light-quark
hybrids would suggest the existence of heavy-quark hybrids and further
motivate dedicated searches for these states.
With continued coordinated experimental and theoretical investiga-
tions we hope to define a complete set of rules for building hadrons that
both describes what is observed in nature and can be derived directly
from QCD. In doing so, we aim to understand how what seems to be a
simple spectrum of hadrons emerges from the complex interactions of
quarks and gluons in QCD.
